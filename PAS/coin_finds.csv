A man named William Currell was engaged in the search for water, and his spade struck upon a pewter or white metal vessel, not more than five or six inches below the surface, which had already been broken into several pieces. It was, however, dug out from the ground, and was found to contain no less than 1496 silver coins, some cast silver ingots that had been cut into strips, and a silver ring set with an intaglio. The vessel has, so far as possible, been restored to its original form.<br />It may be described as bottle-shaped. In height it is about 9 1/4 inches, and 7 inches in greatest diameter, the base being 4 inches across. Since the woodcut was made, the neck of the vessel, about 1 1/2 inches in length, has been found by Mrs. Kettlewell. It is about 1 1/4 inches inside diameter, and shows traces of there having been a handle to the vessel..<br />The silver ring, of which also a woodcut is given, is of a not uncommon character, with the gem - a carnelian - projecting a considerable distance beyond the socket in which it is mounted. It presents the flattened oval opening for the finger so common in Roman rings. The gem has a figure of Mars bearing a trophy and spear engraved in intaglio upon it..<br />The pieces of cast silver are five in number, not counting a small fragment, which has probably been broken off from one of them. One is a small lenticular cake about 1 1/4 inch in diameter, which seems to have been run into a depression in clay or sand. It has an indentation from a chisel on its upper surface. Its weight is 516 grains.<br />Two of the other pieces are portions of another and large flat cake of silver about 2 1/2 inches in diameter, which has been cut into three by means of two parallel cuts with a chisel. Only the middle strip, which is about 5/8 inch wide, was present, and one of the outside segments. These weigh 248 and 806 grains respectively.<br />The other two pieces are segments of cakes of the same character; one of them about 2 1/2 inches long and 1 inch broad in the middle, weighs 818 grains; the other 2 1/4 inches long and 3/4 inch in extreme breadth, weighs 644 grains.

It seems to me to be interesting for two matters (1) the absence of any coins of 375-378, and (2) the fact that none of the coins are clipped to a smaller size.

There are 209 which have been separated and also an unknown number in a solid clay-and-coin clod not separated at the time of writing.

Times, 19 July 1962; SCMB, Oct. 1962<br />""On 9 July 1962 a hoard of fourth century coins was found during excavations in a fourth century building site which ran along and to the South of Watling Street adjacent to Magiovinium. The coins were probably originally contained in a bag as a metal clasp was found in conjunction with them. At the time of discovery the excavator (R.W. Griffiths) stated there were approximately 251 loose coins and a conglomerate of perhaps 400 more. The hoard was sent to the Ashmolean Museum for examination where an attempt was also made to separate the centrally corroded mass into its individual elements but without much success and a significant number of coins remained fused together. A summary report of the hoard's contents was sent to the excavators and the coins were lodged in the Buckinghamshire County Museum in Aylesbury where they remain today.<br />In 1984 the coins were again brought to the Ashmolean Museum for examination. At that time 306 pieces could be isolated and listed. The general condition of the coins was very poor - many were totally illegible and a significant number partially so. In the initial report on the hoard it was suggested that the coins may have been originally fused together as a result of fire which also caused the cup-shape form of some pieces, and the fact that in some cases the side of the coins seems almost to have melted away..<br />The interest of this hoard lies in the fact that it is composed almost entirely of ancient copies to which a few of the very common coins of 330 to 348 were added. There are no coins of Magnentius and Decentius nor are there any of the early post-reform FEL TEMP REPARATIO pieces of larger module and higher silver contents. This hoard consists of pieces of the lowest possible value and thus either the better quality pieces have been excluded or never came into the possession of the hoarder.

A pottery bowl, covered by a lid, was found to contain a bronze bowl (used as a liner), two pieces of folded silver plate, remains of a linen-lined leather purse, and 30 Roman gold coins.<br />The pottery bowl (rim diameter 15.8 cm) is burnished on the exterior and has a dark grey to black surface. The upper part of the body is decorated by double lines in zig-zag pattern, enclosing in each triangle three impressed roundels. The style has been called 'Romano-Saxon'. The 'Castor Box' lid (diameter 21.7 cm) is a typical Nene Valley product.<br />The bronze bowl (diameter 13.5 cm, height 9 cm) is of thin sheet bronze and consists of an upper band riveted to a lower part, formed from one piece of metal. Two handles were found inside it, loose, but their original points of attachment are marked by patches of solder. The two pieces of folded silver plate weigh respectively 642 gm and 321 gm. The linen purse lining is in plain weave.""<br />The 30 coins, all solidi, fell into 3 groups:<br />1. 4 coins of the last years of the reign of Constantine I, and his three sons, Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans, as Caesars, up to AD 337.<br />2. 3 coins of AD 337-40, of the joint reigns of Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans, as Augusti.<br />3. 22 coins of AD 340-50, from the death of Constantine II until the revolt of Magnentius in the west brought the reign of Constans to an end.<br />""The final piece, making up the total of 30, is a contemporary forgery of a solidus of Constans from the mint of Trier.

While excavating with a mechanical grab, the find was revealed high up in the sand cliff. It consisted of about 30 lbs. weight of bronze coins contained in an earthenware pot, over which had been placed a second larger pot. Above it lay an ironstone slab, to mark the burial place of the hoard. Unfortunately in the mechanical operations the pots were smashed and the coins (estimated at something over 3,000) were scattered and dispersed. Through the efforts of Mr Tom Gardner, the Ampthill archaeologist, and Mr. C. Bunker, the pit foreman, with their helpers, 2,050 coins and fragments of pottery were recovered. A remarkable feature of all the coins was their mint-fresh condition, the features of the emperors, the details of the reverses, the inscriptions, and mint-marks being clear and clean-cut.

On a piece of paper preserved with the impression is the following account: 'On [] 1910 Mrs John Tonkin of Carn Golla, north-west of the Beacon, picked up in a field recently enclosed from the Common, which had just been scuffed or harrowed, a Roman gold coin the size of a half-sovereign, bright and in perfect preservation [Description follows.]' We are very grateful to Colin Harris and Clare Murton of St Agnes Museum for drawing this impression to our attention.

Furze found a hoard of Roman coins under a rock on Park Hill, above the present Okehampton Railway Station, and within a stone's throw of the old Roman road or supposed Roman road.<br /><br />The collection would seem to have been secreted under a leaning natural rock on the side of the hill; earth had accumulated, and the whole covered up till discovered by Mr. Furze. He had originally found about 160, and 40 more were recovered by sifting the earth by the deputation.<br />A considerable number of the coins was broken or so corroded as to be indecipherable. The entire collection was made up of third brass pieces of dates between AD 320 and 330. It is very probable that it was the store of a beggar who sat beside the Roman road begging, as every coin was of the smallest size and most insignificant value in itself.

The first and third which we removed, especially the upper part, seemed artificial. Some coins were first found in the small space or crevice between the first or second group, the remainder under one of the layers in the centre group lying some 18 inches from the edge of the block; and evidently placed there originally.<br />If I might be allowed to venture an opinion I conceive that originally all the coins were placed in the horizontal crevice, and that the outside group of rocks especially the upper part of it had been afterwards placed in the front position from which we removed them.<br />' (Sgd) Edward Harris.""<br />'Neither the name of the finder nor the number of coins is mentioned, but the account suggests that more than four coins were discovered, in which case the find may be classed as a small hoard.'""<br />The 4 coins were all AE:<br />AE<br />Hadrian 1<br />Constantine I 1<br />Constantine II (Caes.?) 1<br />Decentius 1<br /><br />4<br />(sest.)<br />(GLORIA EXERCITVS, 2 stand.)<br />(GLORIA EXERCITVS, 1 stand.)<br />(Vot XXV [sic?])<br />""'The condition of the coins which apart from the 2nd century sestertius show little wear, suggest that the deposit is approximately of mid 4th-century date.<br />'<br />'Blackey Tor cannot be identified with certainty: it is most likely, according to Mr. B.

The coins were stuck together on the under-side of a flat stone in spoil mechanically excavated in 1940 when the face of the inner rampart on the west and south sides of the camp was scarped to render it tank-proof in the event of an invasion. In 1940 or 1941, a coin of identical type had been found at the same place by Ian Ellis, and he now estimates that during these years he and several others must have found at this spot a total, including the bulk discovery, of about 120 coins, all of similar type. The uniformity of the collection leaves no doubt that it formed part of a single hoard, but what proportion it may represent of the total originally hidden is quite uncertain.<br />The circumstances of discovery make it probable that the hoard was concealed at or near the base of the forward scarp of the inner rampart or perhaps in the near side of the ditch itself, which had already become nearly filled up by late Roman times. No special reason can be suggested for the choice of site for concealment, but the slope below the east rampart has been known, through a number of discoveries during the hundred years since the making of the railway cutting and tunnel, as the site of a Roman cemetery serving the inhabitants of Durnovaria; and some undefined activity in or near the camp itself in the early fourth century AD was attested by the excavations in 1939.'""

Floors, where present, consisted of trampled chalk.<br />Within the building there were six furnaces built of Portland stone, two of them slight semicircular structures; the other four were well-constructed and large - 1.50 m. long, surviving to a height of 60.0 cm.

The deposit from Oven 4 has been included here separately in IARCH-E0A2E2, although the specific number of coins from that context is not known, but Cooke considers them as one hoard.According to Cooke (2007, 7) ""However, using the published coin list (Patrick Greene 1993, 93), it is possible to suggest the likely composition of this hoard. In order to do this, only coins recovered from rubble contexts or those recovered from within oven 4 (see above) have been included. This excludes all the coins recovered from topsoil deposits (some of which may relate to the hoard) but does allow us to examine those coins most likely to be part of the hoard. Using these criteria, a minimum of 304 coins can be suggested as belonging to the hoard""It is not possible to give a precise reconstruction of the number of coins from each period from the graph in Cooke's figure 3 (2007, 17) as the figures are not given. However c. 175 of the coins are attributed to the House of Theodosius and the remainder are mostly fourth century or unidentified 3rd to 4th century coins, with a small number of late third century coins.N.B.

Interested Museums were unable to acquired and the hoard was sold at auction by Spink. The portion in the Fitzwilliam was the Gift of Richard Beleson and the San Fransisco Ancient Numismatics Society in honor of Ted Buttrey. (EG): About 75% of the coins in the hoard were clipped, with 42% only lightly clipped (""clipping factor 1""). Generally, clipping was spread throughout the hoard, indicating that the coins were circulating together at the time of burial. Somewhat higher proportions of the coins from the period 367 to 378 are unclipped than in earlier and later periods. No coins were found to be heavily clipped, although the edges of some of the later coins were sometimes poorly preserved. The hoard contained 16 obviously irregular coins. During conservation some coins were identified as silver plated and others were thought to show the effects of surface enrichment due to chemical removal of the baser metal to improve the silvery appearance of the coin . This was difficult to distinguish visually from the effects of silver corrosion and analysis would be required to confirm this theory. Coins thought to be plated during conservation that appeared regular in type were included in the main catalogue and marked as possibly plated in the footnotes. Generally, the degree of preservation was very good, due to the conditions of burial. Removal of the coins from the pot was carried out in layers but there was no obvious stratification apart from the fact that the miliarenses were found at the top, in the neck of the pot. Although merely speculation, this fact could support a votive function for the hoard, with the offering intended to appear more generous than it was. Alternatively, this could have been due to the practicalities of packing a large number of coins into a small vessel (though they would have fitted through the neck of the vessel without difficulty). The hoard contained a few unusual coins. A siliqua of Valentinian II minted in Siscia (no. 103) has a previously unknown reverse type of a chi-rho within a wreath without additional legend. The mintmark SISCP suggests that it fits into the issue of that mint dated between AD 375 and 378. A siliqua of Valentinian II minted in Trier (no. 83) is a variant of Hoxne 327 and RIC IX 43/57a, with the mintmark TRP. This may be an engraver's error; another coin with the same reverse die is in the BM (1954,0508.7).

Some boys, playing about the streamlet which rises on the north side of the meadow found in its bed a small vase and thirty or forty coins lying in the gravel. The news quickly spread among the peasantry, who, in expectation of finding a mine of wealth, lost no time in exploring the bed of the stream and thus eventually some hundred and forty coins and seven perfect vases, the produce of these unlicensed explorations, were recovered by the agent of the Earl of Shaftesbury, the lord of the manor; and under this gentleman's directions, a further search was made, which resulted in the discovery of a few coins; a large quantity of the debris of the same kind of pottery as the vases; an iron lance, or spear-head, three inches in length and one inch and three-quarters broad, with the socket and point eaten away by rust; a disc of bronze three inches and three-eighths in diameter; a few short pieces of thin tubular bronze of the size of a tobacco pipe, two or three of them having a rude linear ornamentation; some animal bones, horses' teeth; a few flint flakes; and one red amber bead.<br />""<br />The seven complete pots were all small, the largest being only 4 1/2 in. high. Four were of dark ""Upchurch"" ware, two were of gray ware, probably from the New Forest kilns, and one was said to be a two-handled patera of Samian ware.

Two treasure hunters have found a hoard of 1000 Roman coins dating from the reign of Emperor Constantine the Great, 1600 years ago. Mr. George Fletcher, 64, and Mr. Ken Emery, 52, both from Bournemouth, discovered the silver coins, believed to be worth thousands of pounds, in a potato field near Poole, in Dorset.""<br />-Glasgow Herald, 27 Jan. 1986, 3<br />-""Upton...: A hoard of 1663 nummi down to AD 318 is recorded.""<br />-Britannia, XVII (1986), 418.<br />""The hoard was discovered on January 23 1986 by two treasure hunters using metal detectors on a field near Upton, Dorset. It was contained in two pottery containers, which were found about 9 inches apart; the larger, containing about 1300 coins, was also buried about 10 inches deeper than the smaller, which was itself about 12 inches below the modern ground surface.<br />Unfortunately the coins from the two containers were not kept separate, so we cannot be certain whether or not the coins were distributed evenly between them. The few coins still adhering to the pottery fragments, when they arrived at the British Museum, and the coin stains on those fragments suggest that there was no distinction between the two lots: at any rate both larger and smaller coins were present in each container. A report by D R Watkins and V Rigby on the pottery and on the archaeological context of the hoard has been published separately. (Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society Proceedings 108 (1986), 181ff.)<br />The hoard comprised 1685 coins [7 radiates (1 'quin.') and 1678 folles or nummi] mostly in the names of Constantine I, Licinius and Maximinus, although it included a few coins of Constantine's sons Constantine II and Crispus. Most of the coins were struck between 310 and 318, on the two consecutive standards of 72 and 96 to the pound, and most, of course, come from British and Gallic mints.

555,IARCH-DB25A1,PAS: Good Easter 555,,,hoard,,,,1998.0,2003.0,"16 solidi (Arcadius, 6; Honorius, 9 (1 plated copy); Constantine III, 1). `A total of five late Roman gold solidi and one plated imitation of a solidus were found by Mr M J Cuddeford while searching with a metal detector on a ploughed field in the parish of Good Easter, Essex, about 6 miles north-west of Chelmsford. The first coin (no. 2) was discovered by Mr Cuddeford in February 1992 and Mr Cuddeford found a further 5 coins while searching on the same field in 1993. The coins were found scattered over an area some 70 metres square; no trace of a container was found. They were declared Treasure Trove at an inquest held on 19 May 1993, and were subsequently acquired by Chelmsford Museum Service.' R Bland, CHRB X, p. 482. `Addenda of six gold solidi were recovered from the site of the Good Easter hoard by Mr M. J. Cuddeford while searching with a metal detector in 1998. A further two solidi were found in September 2001, October 2002 and August 2003. This brings the total to 16 solidi, including one plated imitation in the original find. The Lyon solidus of Constantine III (RIC X: 1505) is a particularly noteworthy find, slightly amending the closing date (the four G's in the reverse legend indicates striking prior to the death of Arcadius in 408), and considerably increasing the importance of the hoard. No gold of Constantine III occurred in the Hoxne hoard; the Anne Robertson Inventory lists only two British hoards, Stanmore and Eye (RBCH 1619 &amp; 20), both found in 1781 and long dispersed, but which were said to have each contained at least one example. On the continent, the most prolific find of Constantine III gold comes from a hoard of 188 solidi found in 1754 at Menzelen, Germany which apparently included at least 33 examples. The finder generously waived his share of the reward and the coins have been acquired by Chelmsford Museum Service.' Report by Richard Abdy.

It dates to the early part of the reign of Octavian (later Augustus), 31 BC - AD 14 and could have been a regular part of the Romano-British coin circulation up until the early part of the second century AD. However, very occasional evidence from other finds of late Roman coins (e.g. the fifth century Patching hoard from Sussex and the fourth century Beaurains hoard from Arras in northern France) shows that such denarii from the Republican / early Imperial period sometimes survived into later periods - presumably kept for their silver content as the denomination would no longer have been familiar so long after the discontinuation of denarius production (in the third century AD).

They were found in March, 1824, at Terling Place, near Witham, Essex, with a large hoard of gold and silver coins. The discovery occurred under the following circumstances: some workmen were engaged in forming a new road through Colonel Strutt's Park, and, the earth being soaked by heavy rains, the cartwheels sunk up to their naves. The driver of the cart saw some white spots upon the mud adherent to the wheels, which he imagined to be small buttons: at that moment Colonel Strutt's steward came to the spot, and perceived coins upon the wheels. Not fewer than 300 were picked up at that time. Three days after, Colonel Strutt's steward made further search, and found a small vase, almost perfect, in which had been deposited the two gold rings, and thirty aurei, of the size of a guinea, with several silver coins, all as bright as if recently struck. Several other vases, in which no coins or other objects were found, lay near the spot; they crumbled to pieces on removal; the perfect vase was carried to Terling Place.""<br />The 2 gold rings, 30 solidi, and 304 of the silver coins were also taken to Terling Place, where they were kept, along with two bronze coins, which were apparently found at the same time and place.<br />J. Talbot, in AJ, III (1846), 162f., list of coins, figs. of rings<br />In 1933, Lord Rayleigh allowed B.H.St.J. O'Neil to consult manuscript letters describing the find, and to re-examine and re-publish the pot and coins. Mr. O'Neil concluded that the hoard had consisted of a pot of silver coins, which had originally numbered 300-400, and a pot of gold coins numbering 30, along with the two gold rings, while the 2 bronze coins may have come from a Romano-British habitation site in the neighbourhood. The pot which had contained the silver coins had been smashed by the cart wheels.<br />The pot which contained the gold coins was a small jar of hard, fine red ware, 3 1/4 in. high and 2 3/4 in. wide, covered with a lighter red-brown slip. The interior surface was grooved. On the upper part of the pot was a graffito I/VTVXYII.<br />One of the gold rings was about 3/4 in. in diameter, and was made of a thin strip of gold, ornamented with gold wire. The oval bezel was of paste, with an engraved design which is now too worn to identify. The other gold ring was also about 3/4 in. in diameter, and was formed of a flat strip of gold, ornamented with beaded and plaited gold wire. The bezel was lost.<br />M. Henig, Corpus of Roman Engraved Gemstones from British Sites, BAR 8 (1974), ii, 94, no. 724, described the details of the rings as follows: ""Ear of corn. Very schematically represented. Nicolo paste. Surface worn and indistinct. 15 by 13 mm. Flat, Oval<br />Another ring set with a colourless crackly crystal of Paste, uncut and en Cabochon.<br />""<br />The coins preserved at Terling Place were 26 solidi, and 296 sil. 4 solidi and 8 sil. having been lost since 1824.<br />Sol.

O'Neil's lists."" ******* Dating from Bland and Loriot (latest coins either 404 or 407-8). The eyewitness accounts quoted by O'Neil (1933 146-7) would seem to suggest that the silver coins were found in one pot (not recorded) and the gold and finger rings in another (the pot drawn and described). A possible organic container is also hinted at; ""some part of the Earth appears as if it had been wood perished from time laying in the Earth"" (R. Ellis quoted in O'Neil 1933, 147).Note that other vessels were found at the findspot and that two bronze coins were assumed not to have been part of the hoard (they were a small Urbs Roma type of Constantine I mm TRP and an unidentifiable radiate).Coins in original find listed in Archaeological Journal 3 (1846) p. 162 as follows:""The gold coins comprised eight of Valentinian, one of Valens, one of Gratian, nine of Arcadius, and thirteen of Honorius. The silver pieces were thus enumerated ; Constantius, ten; Julian, not<br />laureate, one ; Julian, twenty-three, including one bearing a second head; Jovian, one ; Valentinian, twenty-one ; Valens, forty-three ; Gratian, thirtyeight; Magnus Maximus, thirty-six; Victor, five; Valentinian, junior, five; Eugenius, seventeen; Theodosius, twenty-seven; Arcadius, forty-five; Honorius, thirty ; with two silver coins, uncertain, and two of bronze, ranging from about A.D. 335 to 445.""",51.804109999999994,0.57291,highest,PAS UK Finds,1/13/2015 11:57,46:26.0,3/4/2015 11:12,,"Bland, R. and Loriot, X., 2010    Roman and Early Byzantine Gold Coins found in Britain and Ireland    London:  Royal Numismatic Society 154-155    , no. 185    O'Neil, B.H.St.J., 1933    The Terling Treasure    London:  RNS 145-170

The accession number B 1471 showed that the vessel was part of the late Lord Bathurst's collection, made up of Roman objects found in Cirencester in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. No special find-place was entered in the register, but the coins were there recorded as being in the pot. As both pot and coins were recognizable as late Roman types, it was presumed that the two constituted a hoard, and the coins were therefore sent to Mr. B.H. St.J. O'Neil for examination.<br />The pot is a small squat vessel, with everted rim and a well-marked neck; it measures 4 in. high, 3 1/2 in. rim diameter, increasing to 4 in. on the body; about a third of the rim is missing. It is made of coarse dark grey clay, containing a good deal of pounded shell as 'backing'. The surface is black, except the neck which is grey in irregular patches, due probably to bad stacking in the kiln.

The soil round it was noticeably dark and, together with the confined area of discovery, strongly suggested that the coins had been dropped or deposited in a purse or covering which had since perished.<br />Subsequent to the deposition of the hoard, the floor of the room had been repaired. Patches of poor, whitish cement were inserted into cavities in the pavement to bring the floor to an even surface with the broken edges of the original mosaic.

It is, in my view, difficult to compress the whole of this varied sequence of events into the three decades of the fourth century.

The site was therefore probably deserted by c. 380.<br />A feature of the Brean series is the large proportion of the barbarous imitations.<br />The main bulk is composed of copies ranging from 16 mm to 3 mm in diameter, and there is also a number of more or less plain minims - 'fallen horseman derivatives' - from 6 mm to 2 mm across. In all, thirty-two separate specimens, or 17 per cent, are 3 mm or less in diameter, and fall therefore within the Lydney category of 'minimissimi'.<br />Extravagant claims have been made as to the date of such coins.<br />Dates as late as the mid-sixth century have been put forward, and a shortage of bronze in sub-Roman times has been adduced to account for the tiny module of the coins. This is entirely unwarranted archaeologically. It is unfortunate also that the internal evidence of the Lydney hoard, the evidence of its associations, and that of stray finds of 'minimissimi' elsewhere on the site were not urged more strongly in the original report. As Kent has recently pointed out, nothing in the orthodox coins [i.e. from the Lydney Temple] is later than 360, although the Lydney site in general - founded 364 abounded in coins of the House of Valentinian..<br />Two suggestions can be made. The first is that the use of the term 'minimissimi' should cease; it is imprecise and, in fact, has been abused; moreover it suggests the existence of a shadowy 'denomination' for which there is no warrant in our present state of knowledge. Secondly, in view of the striking corroboration of Kent's thesis, attempts to discern copies with perhaps radiate obverses paired with 'fourth-century' reverses, or any attempt to link barbarous copies chronologically with the earliest Saxon issues of sceattas - in short to suggest that copies of the type here discussed, or any other type, circulated beyond the limits of the monetary crisis which called them forth, seems ill advised in the extreme.""<br />Lydney, 1929, hoard on loan to Ashmolean Museum, Oxford<br />Examined 473 coins, 1978 (ASR)"" ******* The 183 fragments of metal includes some coin fragments and others that may be classed as objects, but all have been counted as coins here.Full discussion of groups with av. weights by Wheeler 1932.",51.72133,-2.5580000000000003,highest,PAS UK Finds,1/13/2015 11:57,47:03.9,10/20/2016 10:13,,"Boon, G.C., 1961    The Roman temple at Brean Down, Somerset, and the dating of 'minimissimi'    London:  RNS 191-197

The hoard was certainly deposited not earlier than the building of the Temple in or after AD 364.<br />2. The lower limit of date for the deposit of the hoard cannot be determined with absolute certainty from external evidence, since, at this point, the slab-paving beneath the level of which it was found was not actually in position. The slabs had here subsided into the soft earth containing the coins; but whether this should be taken to imply that the soft earth was already there when the slabs were first laid (after AD 367) or whether it was due to the subsequent burial of the coins beneath the slabs, it was impossible to determine.<br />3. Nevertheless, if the external evidence for the date of the hoard is open to doubt, it is certain that the coins formed a true hoard.

The hoard thus appears not to have been in a container of any sort and that it was not part of the original interments.""<br />The den. of Constantius II and the mil. of Julian II are in Dept. of Coins and Medals, BM (BM Register of Coin Accessions, March 1969), and the silver ring in the Dept. of Prehistoric and Romano-British Antiquities, BM.<br />The other 54 sil., are in Cheltenham Art Gallery and Museum. ******* Coins BM 1969,0303.1- One skull lay to the south, indicating a pagan burial, but details of the burials were difficult to determine.

662,IARCH-BB720C,PAS: Foxcote 662,,,hoard,,,200,1863.0,1863.0,"Robertson 2000, 350 no. 1434:""""The account of the Foxcote Tumulus, as given by Mr. Norwood, is interesting and worthy of notation. The following are the facts as supplied by Mr. Norwood:-<br />A party of antiquaries, General Younghusband, Captain Bell, Mr. E. Harford, Dr. Bird, and the Rev. T.W. Norwood, visited the locality referred to on the 25th February, 1863, where they found the remains of what had been a large Tumulus, about 20 yards in diameter. There were no indications of those large stones which mark so characteristically so many Cotteswold barrows. A heap of greasy black earth occupied the centre of the area. A human skeleton was found, that of a young person, said to have been of the female sex. It is important to notice that there was but one body here buried, for in our usual chambered Tumuli of unknown age we generally find several bodies. The body is said to have been found lying at length, not doubled up. There were marks of fire on a few bones and stones, and some bits of pottery lying about within the area of the Tumulus were identical in kind with the Roman black pottery of the whole district. In the black earth were found 11 or 12 pieces of flint, of the sort known as 'flint flakes'. These have been found in graves of Roman age, according to Mr. Thomas Wright, as well as in 'primaeval' and Saxon graves, and must often have been brought over long distances.<br />A piece of rusty iron was found, apparently belonging to the interment. Many Roman coins were found in the Tumulus according to the workmen, not fewer than 200. Six were picked up by Mr. Norwood's party, bearing the names of Valens, Gratianus, Gallienus and Constantine 2nd. The others said to have been found there were mostly small brass of Valens, Valentinian, Tetricus, Gratianus, Victorinus, Gordian, Maximian, Postumus, Tacitus, Claudius Gothicus, Constantine 2nd, Constans and Constantius, with several of the 'Urbs Roma' and 'Constantinopolis' type. With these were five or six small coins, very small and rude, not Roman, but probably struck in imitation of Roman coins. The coins were not contained in any vessel, but were scattered broadcast throughout the mound. Mr. Norwood has come to the conclusion, from the foregoing facts, that this grave was Roman or Romano-British, of the date of about 400 AD; and he gives it as his opinion that in no other instance, in so far as he is aware, has it been found possible to fix an approximate date to an ancient Tumulus with so much probability as in the instance thus brought under our notice.""<br />Proc. Cotteswold Nat. Field Club III (1865), 198f.<br />Dr. Bird, a member of Mr. Norwood's party, gave a briefer account in Proc. Cotteswold Nat. Field Club VI, 4 (1876), 335f.:<br />""The Foxcote Tumulus. In this Tumulus there were two Roman coins and a half found in the black earth, and a broken earthen vessel containing small coins. There was a dry wall across the heap of stones, and a kist near its centre, the ends and sides of it formed of flat stones placed on their edges and covered with flat stones two feet square. The kist contained the remains of only one female.<br />[Description of skull and bones].<br />The flint flakes were about fourteen altogether; the largest were in the red earth on the base of the Tumulus. The Tumulus measured twenty-six yards in one direction and twenty-three in the other, and the centre was raised from eight to ten feet.""<br />G.B. Witts, Arch. Handbook of the Co. of Glos. (1883), 98, said of the Foxcote Tumulus: ""This lies on the top of the hill, one mile south of Dowdeswell, and four miles south-east of Cheltenham"", summarised the accounts given by Rev. T.W. Norwood and Dr. Bird, and added: ""Between 300 and 400 Roman coins were found in the black earth near the surface.""<br />Cp. Helen O'Neil and L.V. Grinsell, in Trans. Bristol and Glos. Arch. Soc., 79 (1960), 137.<br />L.V. Grinsell, in a letter, Jan. 1966, observed ""that the barrow called St. Paul's Epistle (Dowdeswell parish) is about 1000 yards from that on Foxcote Hill (Withington parish).

The hoard was in an exposed section of a machine-dug trench. It appeared to lie in a shallow depression, c. 20cm deep and c. 20cm in diameter, overlying a dark grey sandy silt which may have been a Roman foreshore deposit. It was sealed by a layer of grey clay which represented post-Roman (possibly Mediaeval) flooding.<br />The find-spot is some 250m. east of London Bridge and c. 45m south of the modern river wall. It is some 150m east of the higher ground which formed the main Roman settlement of Southwark, and is in an area which was mainly covered by creeks and marshes during much of the Roman period. However, the depth at which the coins were found, 1.20m above ordnance datum, suggests, on the basis of evidence elsewhere in Southwark, that the findspot was dry ground during at least a part of the Roman period. In addition, it was found approximately 20m west of a stone building (excavated in 1983) which was constructed, probably, during a later recession of the Roman river, and which confirms Roman activity nearby.<br />The circumstances of discovery did not allow the hoard to be related stratigraphically to the building. Neither was it clear whether the coins were deliberately concealed in a hole, or merely dropped either on a land surface or even into mud or water. No trace of a container was noted, and the coins were loosely scattered within the depression in which they were found. Since the hoard came from the edge of a machine-dug trench, some coins may have been lost when the trench was dug. However, the size and shape of the depression suggests that at least half of the hoard was probably recovered..<br />The latest coin in the hoard dated to 378-83. However, of the 36 Valentinianic coins identified, 21 (including most of the latest coins in the hoard) were in a state of wear which suggested that they had been in circulation for some period, while a further eleven were somewhat more heavily worn. Only three showed slight wear. It seems possible, therefore, that the coins may have been lost during the early years of the 380s, though the absence of Theodosian issues presumably indicated that the date of loss was not long after it.""<br />The 44 AE coins were catalogued according to types and mints.<br />M.

Williams-Hunt, of the 2nd Bn. Royal Fusiliers, has reported a Roman Site on Chilbolton Down, with signs of occupation from early days to mid-fourth century. It consists of a flat area or terrace on the side of the hill about 60ft. by 18ft. It lies 1 mile 3 furlongs S.W. of the Roman Road running N.W. from Winchester and half a mile S.E. of the straight piece of road running under Woolbury Camp from Stockbridge to Sutton Scotney.<br />The hoard of coins was found about the end of July 1941 by some Royal Artillery gunners in digging a trench, in what appeared to be the site of a rubbish pit with oxen bones, rough pottery shards and general rubbish. The two pottery vessels which contained the coins were shattered and unfortunately half of one disappeared into a sandbag and could not be traced. Fragments will probably be recovered when the sandbags rot. Coins in this vessel were rapidly dispersed amongst the soldiers and not many were recovered. The other vessel was recovered complete except for the handle, which seems to have been lost in ancient times, and one small chip in the shoulder.<br />The contents were about 900 coins, all in very fine condition, bronze or silver washed. Mr. Williams-Hunt had not the exact list when he wrote, but roughly puts the varieties as follows:<br />Constantine I 60 per cent.<br />Crispus 15 per cent.<br />Constantine II 25 per cent.<br />Helena 5 per cent.<br />Licinius 1 coin only<br />Fausta 5 per cent.<br />Mr. Williams-Hunt disclaims being a coin expert, but with one exception has seen all types before.<br />There is a grand array of different mint marks, but though he has noted these he cannot answer as to their rarity. One exceptional coin is a small bronze one. Obv., a laur. bust; rev., inscription only:-<br />*<br />CONSTANT<br />INUS<br />AUG<br />P.T.R.<br />Incidentally Mr. Williams-Hunt says he has included the common VRBS ROMA and Constantinopolis-types which are well represented under Constantine I in the above estimate.<br />He also sends a 'rather poor snap' he took of the flagons. He has repaired the smaller one, but the larger example is minus the neck, and adds that there are several fragments which do not join.<br />The coins and vessels are, I believe, in the possession of Mr. G.W.

Initially they removed the coins from the site, an action which resulted in the loss of an unspecified number, but subsequently surrendered the great majority of them to the owner, Mrs. H. Marsh. Mrs. Marsh submitted them, together with the sherds of the pot which once contained them, to the Hampshire County Museum Service for identification.<br />The sherds form part of a New Forest grey ware jar or jug, with decoration in the form of vertical and horizontal grooves, and with saltire crosses scored on its body. This is a known type, catalogued by Fulford (BAR 17 (1975), fig. 33, 20.1). This form had a terminal date of c. AD 350, which is in close agreement with the termination date of the hoard. The sherds recovered constitute only part of the vessel; the rim and base are missing. While the base and body sherds exhibit fresh breaks, the neck is abraded and worn, presumably as a result of plough or cultivation damage. As it was not possible to view the find 'in situ', nor recover details of its discovery, this is the only clue to the manner of deposition. Two other small Roman sherds collected from the area of the find were also submitted for identification. They are from different vessels but both are also of New Forest type. After they had been identified, the coins were retained by the owner, but the pottery sherds were donated to the Museum Service, where they are housed as A1984.29.""<br />The hoard comprised AE coins - 484 regular issues of AD 320-48 and 126 irregular copies of types of AD 330-48 - making a total of 610.<br />The 484 regular coins were:<br />Trier Lyons Arles Rome Aq.

It is therefore not possible to reconstruct the form of the pot with any degree of certainty. Most of the footring is present; it is rounded in section, and has a diameter of about 6 cm. The wall of the vessel rises at a fairly steep angle to a surviving height of c. 8 cm. The point of greatest diameter would have been above this. The most likely form would have been a simple cooking-pot shape.<br />The fabric is light pink, with sparse but quite large brick-red and cream inclusions. Traces remain of the slip, which is thin, matt, and a bright orange in colour.

The coins were declared Treasure Trove at an Inquest held on 23 January 1981.<br />108 coins were found in a nucleus, and 41 scattered in the same area. A further 6 were discovered on a subsequent occasion. Nearly all the coins from the scatter were clipped, showing that clipped coins had been added after the rest of the hoard.<br />The coins came from the same place as the 1978 Otterbourne Treasure Trove of 7 miliarenses and 543 [sic] siliquae. Unfortunately the exact findspot of the first hoard cannot be reliably ascertained, and all that is certain is that the two finds came from the same field. They cannot, however, represent two parts of the same hoard as their compositions are rather different..<br />Then followed lists of the 155 sil. from the 1980 hoard, and of 530 out of the 536 sil. from the 1978 hoard. (The total of coins of Honorius in the 1980 hoard was given as 16 instead of 17, although 17 were actually catalogued, making a total of 155)..<br />""This table shows that the 1978 hoard cut off sharply after 388 (except for six coins of the late 390s from the Milan mint) and consequently had no [sic] clipped coins. The 1980 hoard however is rather later, and is typical of some of the latest Roman silver hoards from Britain with a lot of Milan coins and a large percentage of clipped coins. Although the practice of clipping cannot be certainly dated, it suggests a date in the second decade of the fifth century for the deposition of the 1980 hoard.<br />The presence of the six later coins in the 1978 hoard makes the precise relationship of the two hoards acute: the six were clearly added several years after the bulk of the hoard was deposited, and as they are the sort of coins so plentiful in the 1980 hoard it is tempting to think that they might have been added by the owner of that hoard.

It has been severely crushed before or during burial, but the detail of the goldwork remains undamaged.""<br />The oval bezel of dark blue onyx has been engraved with a satyr standing left, holding out right hand to small cupid standing right: the satyr holds crook in left hand, and has cloak over left arm. The area of the intaglio measures 18 by 17 mm. The gold ring weighs 10.1 grammes, and the composition of the gold is 93.9% gold, 3.8% silver and 2.3% copper.<br />Four late Roman silver coins were found at the same time and in the general vicinity of the ring. Although neither coins nor ring were found close together the possibility remains that, given their general contemporaneity, they originally formed part of a hoard, subsequently dispersed by the plough.

In all nine pieces of pottery were recovered with the hoard. There is no reason to suggest that they belong to more than one vessel, indeed seven of them join to form a base (Fig. 110: 1). The remaining two sherds are considerably thinner in section and are from the upper wall of the vessel.<br />The ware is of medium hardness, with orange-surfaces and has an extremely coarse grey core. Throughout it is tempered with large, hard, light-dark grey grog, with occasional fine black inclusions and (?) flint. The surviving portion of the vessel is well made and indicates a flat base and marked internal rilling of the lower wall. In addition the internal surface is slightly vesiculated. In general terms however the base shows no signs of wear. The edges of several sherds indicate 'old breaks' and there is little doubt that the vessel was cracked 'in situ' prior to its discovery.""<br />A. Havercroft continued his comments by suggesting that the potsherds came from a large jar with a deep, out-turned undercut rim. He compared the form with similar potsherds from the Roman Theatre at Verulamium; Gadebridge; the kiln site at Radlett; and the Roman bath-house at Branch Road, St Albans (cp. Fig. 111: 2).

The bottom of the ditch was not reached and nothing was found in it or the bank, but in a depression near the top of the bank Mr. W. Flux, the gravel-digger who first noticed the sherds and coins found a large part of an undoubted Roman bowl, which goes to show that the bank is not later than the Roman period. Eastward of the bank a terrace of the original soil had been left by a previous gravel-digging, and it was from the thin layer of earth here that the bulk of the finds came. They include potsherds, a lump of lead, rings, a buckle and a socketed knife or sickle of iron, and 22 coins, mostly fourth century, with two worn survivals from the second.

They were all enclosed in a jar of coarse earthenware, which was buried about five feet below the surface of the ground. The jar was surrounded by a rubble wall of loose stones. The locality was the side of a steep rise near the fountain-head of a strong spring. The jar was broken by the stroke of a pick, and many of the coins were tipped into the railway embankment before it occurred to anybody to secure them. The number of coins in the jar was very great, probably amounting to 5,000. All of these that I have seen were of copper, and most of them exceedingly shabby.

Frere, M.A., F.S.A., were working on the clearance of a Roman building close to St. George's Street, which is marked as No. 6 in the Committee's appeal of May 1949. It was a bath-house, which showed evidence of use from the second to the fourth century AD In one room (No. 7), which was identified as an undressin-room, no less than 261 coins were found in about on-third of the room, i.e. the area where the stratification was undisturbed. Mr. Frere and the present writer are certain that these coins cannot at any time have been a hoard. They were found singly, not in lumps, in the crevices of and on the flagged floor of the room. A thick layer of debris, which was the result of the collapse of the building, lay upon the floor and so on the coins. This had not been disturbed since its fall, and it follows that the coins were found in the positions which they occupied when the building fell into ruin. The natural conclusion from this is that they were lost singly, presumably by patrons of the baths, whilst undressing in the room.<br />The 261 coins include 64 legitimate issues, 62 barbarous copies thereof of normal size, 33 similar barbarous copies, but of smaller size, usually called minimi, 60 small enough to be dubbed minimissimi, and 42 whole or fragmentary illegible coins of normal size..<br />The minimi are those which have a diameter of 5-6 mm. A few show traces of the legionary spearing fallen horseman type; none show any other type. A few have been roughly cut from larger coins, but most are on quite wel-made, circular flans. The minimissimi are smaller still, 3-4 mm. in diameter as a rule, but there is one of 2.5 mm., and even one of barely 1.5 mm. which is not a piece of another coin, but an entity in itself, and is the smallest thing of its kind which the present writer has ever seen. Of these, 12, including one of 3 mm. diameter, show traces of the legionary spearing fallen horseman type.<br />""<br />B.H.St.J. O'Neil, in NC, 1948, 226-9, full discussion of coins<br />Cp. C.H.V. Sutherland, in NC, 1949, 242-4<br />S.S. Frere, and Sally Stow, in Arch. of Cant., VII (1983), 34f., gave a list of the coins, and added, of the room on whose tiled floor the coins were found: ""Perhaps it was the apodyterium, but this is unlikely because of its position.

Group A came from the middle of the field and probably represents a late or post-Valentinianic bronze hoard with extra 'intruders'; group B from the west end of the field; and group C from the east end of field. It is difficult to say to what extent or if any of B and C belong to the hoard or whether they are an accumulation of site losses. All groups included here.Subsequent actions

Hardwick, Hist. of Preston (1857), 23.<br />The Rev. W. Thornber himself stated that ""in the Fleetwood set of coins also Vespasians were not uncommon"" (Trans. Lancs. and Chesh. Ant. Soc., VI (1887), 108).<br />W.T. Watkin, Roman Lancashire (1886), 238, followed Hardwick's account, but in a further note in Trans. Lancs. and Chesh. Hist. Soc., XXXIX (1887), 49, added:<br />""I found out immediately before the publication of my book [i.e. Roman Lancashire] that the hoard owned by Alderman Brown was still in the possession of his son, Dr. Brown, but it was too late to give any particulars. After the issue of the work, however, Dr. Brown presented the coins (401 in number) to the Museum at Preston, but very singularly they turn out to be a hoard of an entirely different date, ranging from AD 353 to AD 408, and are of the following emperors."" Then came a list of emperors from Constantius II to Honorius.<br />""Can this be the hoard described by Mr. Hardwick?<br />If not there can be but one alternative, i.e. that two hoards were found at the same place, one of the Higher, the other of the Lower Empire; unless the hoard presented to the Preston Museum came from some other part of the country.""<br />The apparently dual nature of the ""Fleetwood"" hoard has been discussed more recently in NC, 1948, 205-14, where the dilemma is clearly stated: ""In support of the view that there were two separate hoards, it may be said that a hoard of fourth-century siliquae could never have been mistaken for a hoard of first- to third-century denarii..<br />In support of the view that only one hoard of Roman silver coins was found at Fleetwood, it may be said that it is most unlikely that two hoards, one of denarii, and the other of siliquae, should be found at the same place, apparently at about the same time, and containing about the same number of coins, namely, about four hundred, while it is even more unlikely that a hoard of 400 denarii, said to be the 'chief feature' of Alderman Brown's collection, should have disappeared without leaving any trace, while its place was taken by a hoard of 400 siliquae, unaccompanied by any account of its discovery.""<br />There were, in 1948, only 388 sil., in Harris Museum, Preston (see no. 1553).<br />-Anne S. Robertson, in NC, 1948, 205-14, types, mints of 388 sil."" ******* EG comments: Robertson considers the two accounts to refer to the same hoard. However, whilst people do sometimes mistake siliqua hoards for denarius hoards in casual references, there are enough details here to suggest that the denarius hoard did exist. Possibly there is some confusion in the part of the earlier author in connecting it with that owner? Shotter's view (1990, 154) is that it is likely that the original provenance of the siliquae became confused as they passed through two private collections (Sir Hesketh Fleetwood and Alderman Brown) and that there were therefore two hoards. Matthew Ball of the Harris Museum, Preston is currently researching the hoard. The record here is for the extant siliqua hoard only (following Robertson in combining these entries and King for the catalogue) and not the denarius hoard to AD 211-7.

From the earth that fell, he is clear that it could not have lain less than three feet from the surface, or more than four. Finding it to be a little pot filled with earth, he had the curiosity to dig the earth out with his knife, and to his surprise observed the Coins above mentioned, wedged in edgeways firmly and closely at the bottom. He counted one hundred on the spot, and is sure there could not have been one more. The place where the discovery was made, is a quarter of a mile from Sproxton Church, on the Highway to Saltby. The Urn is of a coarse dirty brown and white earthen-ware, unglazed, burnt high, and smoked; 2¼ inches high, and 2¾ broad.<br />Near it was found, broken pieces of a larger Urn which evidently had perished, and fragments of human bones, and part of a Skull. On the top of the excavation, there has evidently been a tumulus.""<br />W. Mounsey, in Ms. Min. Soc. Ant., XXXIII (1811-17), 16f. Mounsey gave a similar account in Gent. Mag., 1811, II, 412, but added a list of the coins, siliquae ranging from Constantius II to Honorius, with rev. types, and some mints, along with a fig. of the pot. The sil. were then in the possession of the Duke of Rutland.<br />In 1934, B.H.St.J. O'Neil had examined relevant manuscripts and the coins which still remained in the cabinet of the Duke of Rutland at Belvoir Castle. There were then 95 sil., accompanied by labels for 99 sil., and a drawing of the little pot, of buff-coloured coarse ware, with a heavy roll rim. The hundredth sil., and its label, were missing.<br />Regarding the findspot he observed that ""With the aid of the description of the find, already quoted, and a Belvoir manuscript plan of the area in the hand of William Mounsey<br />it is possible to fix the find-spot of the hoard with tolerable accuracy.<br />The coins were found at the west side of the road from Saltby to Sproxton, five yards from the hedge and 570 yards north of Sproxton Church, half-way up a slight natural rise in the ground. On the other side of the hedge was 'the appearance of an old Stone-pit', which had recently been partially filled in by the freeholder, Amos Ewen, with earth taken from what Mounsey considered to be a tumulus, situated a few yards farther north at the top of the rise. As mentioned above, the bones found at the same time may more probably be connected with this tumulus or adjacent burials than with the coins. Mounsey notes that 'there has been no alteration of the Earth in the memory of man where the Coins were found, and less inequality of the ground on that side of the Fence'.""<br />B.H.St.J.

The globular body is topped by a small finial, presumably a plug of clay used to seal the neck. A small circular fracture can be seen on the finial near the coin-slot, representing either ancient surface spalling or a junction for a handle; no lower attachment for a handle can be seen however, so its existence is extremely doubtful. The vertical coin slot is formed by what appears to be a saw-cut in the neck some 20 mm long, widened by punching or chiselling. This secondary widening may perhaps represent the finder's attempt to extract the coins. It is impossible to gauge the thickness of the walls except at this point.

She provided the following description, and comments:<br />""The pot in which they [i.e. the coins] were found was a shell-tempered jar of the South Midlands family, broadly fourth century, but probably late in the century at Caister.<br />It was found in EIX grid associated with rubbish dumping on the rear of the rampart. The grid square is relevant as I strongly suspect there was much more post Roman disturbance in the area of EIX-X than Green recognised during excavation. This could well account for the fact that the pot was broken, and a few sherds dispersed into a different layer.<br />The small size of the hoard and the relatively large pot, plus the absence of any coins likely to have been part of the hoard in surrounding layers, suggest the hoard was complete."" "" ******* There may be some confusion about the container, about which it is noted: ""It was found in EIX grid associated with rubbish dumping on the rear of the rampart."" It is not mentioned in the JRS account.Mints listed but not all reverse types. Pearce's theory about a Danubian origin is derived from the fact that the most westerly mint is Aquileia although there does appear to be a mint of Arles listed (misattributed to Constantinople).",52.649119999999996,1.7181099999999998,highest,PAS UK Finds,1/13/2015 11:57,01:46.0,2/25/2015 16:49,,"Pearce, B.W., 1953    Some notable Roman coins    London:  RNS 135-136

The coins were found scattered over an area measuring about 30 m by 20 m. Subsequently the site was examined by Andrew Rogerson and myself and more coins were found; the total from the site now stands at 26 gold solidi and four silver siliquae. The gold pieces included one pair and another group of three coins that were adhering to each other. All the coins were found within the ploughsoil at depths ranging between 10 cm and 30 cm. In the centre of the excavation, which was itself beneath the area where the majority of the gold coins had previously been found, was a small zone measuring about 1.75 m square in which nine gold coins and two silver coins were recovered.

    1Coin data quality rating: Excellent (Grade 4)DescriptionThe group comprises one gold solidus and six siliquae. The silver coins have seen some wear and the fact that most are quite heavily clipped would seem to place the date of deposition a few years into the fifth century, probably circa 410Treasure numbers associated with this hoard: 2012 T343, 2017 T800 (addenda of 6 siliquae).Other PAS records associated with this hoard: NMS-281332, NMS-A57D66Subsequent actions

Indeed they were in such a state of decomposition that many crumbled into dust in the act of removing. Nothing but a very black earth could be discovered near them; which leads to the supposition that they were enclosed in a wooden and not an earthen vessel.

Norfolk, some time before 1895 and is now in the Norwich Castle Museum, is a small hoard of 144 third- and fourth-century coins, ranging from Postumus to Honorius.<br />The proportion of barbarous imitations to regular pieces (rather more than half - 78 out of a total of 144) is an outstanding and interesting feature of the hoard and, although there are no 'minimissimi' of the smaller Lydney groups, the number of larger and medium-sized 'minimi' - i.e. those whose flans range from 0.30 in. to 0.50 in. in diameter - is considerable. This in itself may indicate a date for the burial of the hoard well on in the fifth century, although the complete absence of diademed 'minimissimi' and the almost complete absence of pieces of extreme barbarity would suggest that the burial did not take place during the period of copper scarcity which probably began during the latter half of that century.""<br />The 144 coins were 31 ant. and 113 small AE:<br />Ant.

Perkins found, with a metal detector, a hoard of 47 Roman silver coins on Gallows Hill, Thetford. The coins were found in a compact mass in a single spade-full of soil; there was no sign of a container. At a Coroner's Inquest held at Thetford on March 6, 1979 the hoard was found to be Treasure Trove..<br />The coins are all silver siliquae. The majority are in excellent condition, but are slightly worn, indicating that they were in circulation for only a short period of time..<br />The findspot was just south of one of the barrows on Gallows Hill, which was excavated by Andrew Lawson of the Norfolk Archaeology Unit in 1978 and 1979. Evidence from these excavations shows that the Roman land surface was higher than the present surface in the area so that the hoard was probably at a depth of perhaps a foot, close to a prominent land-mark. The coins were found as a compact mass, and had almost certainly been buried in a container of organic material, such as wood or leather which, because of soil conditions, had failed to survive.""<br />The 47 sil. were:<br />Trier Lyons Arles Rome TOTAL<br />Constantius II 5 4 9<br />Julian II, Caes. 1 1<br />Julian II, Aug. 2 10 6 18<br />Valentinian I 1 1<br />Valens 8 1 9<br />Gratian 3 3<br />Theodosius I 2 2<br />Magnus Maximus 4 4<br /><br />19 15 11 2 47<br />Barbara Green, in Norfolk Arch., 37 (1979), 221-3; list of coins based on list by A.M.

This can, however, be regarded only as an approximate date for the hoard's burial, as it had a very weak end (compared with the heavy concentration of issues struck under Julian) and coins of the few years after 388 are rare.

Thanks are due to Mr. John Wallis of the company for this facility; pot and coins have now been returned to him.<br />It has become evident, from the quantity of pottery recovered from the gravel pits at Besthorpe, which are between the river Trent and the Fosse Way and four miles north-north-west of Crococalana [...], that a large and important Roman site has now disappeared in the workings..<br />The hoard must have been buried in the late summer of AD 354 - perhaps not very long before the execution of the Caesar Gallus for maladministration in the east (autumn or early winter).<br />""<br />Then came a full discussion of the 978 regular AE coins in the hoard, ranging from Constantine I, Aug. to Constantius Gallus, and of the 369 AE copies, including their place of manufacture, followed by a list of the 978 regular coins arranged according to chronological periods, Pl.

The surface is slightly burnished.<br />The black grit specks superficially resemble those in the common grey ware of 3rd and 4th century date known at the neighbouring sites of Mansfield Woodhouse, Gringley on the Hill, and Hayton, but the fabric of the Besthorpe flask is darker in colour. The neck is probably to be reconstructed as short and cylindrical, ending in a gently out-curved rim. The basic form is very common early in the Roman period and is evidently one of these forms which were revived in the 4th century by Romano-British potters.

A globular jug of slightly earlier date (mid third century) from Stanground Park Farm shows some similarities to our vessel. It has a profiled foot and rouletted decoration on the body, but the very rounded shape is similar, and it is likely that the vessel from Warsop also had a short, narrow neck and a small handle.

This was supported by the excavation of four paddocks, which appeared to be an addition to the original villa layout.

Two pots of coarse grey ware had been buried side by side a short distance below the surface; their rims, broken away by the plough, were missing.<br />Apart from a handful of earlier coins extending back to Gallienus, the great bulk of the hoard was made up of the issues of Constantine the Great and his sons from about AD 320-347. The latest coins were five examples of the FEL TEMP REPARATIO types of Constantius II and Constans, so that the hoard must have been buried within the few years before 350. Although the coins had been removed from their containers by the finder, it was evident from the metal stains that each pot had held different-sized coins. One had contained over 1,650 Constantinian issues minted from about 320-326. All except about 100 were from the mint of London and were in very fine condition with their silver coating often intact. Of the coins of London those of Constantine II Caesar far outnumber those of Constantine I or Crispus. Among the remaining coins nearly all the imperial mints (except Alexandria) were represented by occasional specimens.<br />The second pot contained nearly 4,00 coins, of which the great majority were issued after 335; GLORIA EXERCITVS (one standard) and VICTORIAE DD AVGGQ NN far outnumber any other reverse type, and the great majority were struck at the mint of Trier. The very thin representation of types struck between 326 and 335 (GLORIA EXERCITVS (2 standards), VRBS ROMA, CONSTANTINOPOLIS) is remarkable.<br />The owner, Mr. F.G.

Brown, in an Appendix to ""A Roman Pewter Hoard from Appleford, Berks."" (1968) in Oxon., XXXVIII (1973), 184-206, noted that the Appleford hoard of coins was found in 1954, ""in Appleford Field at a point which must be about 200 yards north of the area of gravel working which produced the pewter"", and described and illustrated the two pots (204-6, figs.):<br />""The first pot (FIG. 10, A), is grey, quite pale in the break and hard, fired at a relatively high temperature. There is a cordon at the base of the neck; the mouth was probably curled over outwards till it was almost horizontal. The base and lower part of the body have been turned, the upper part of the body has been burnished and there is a rough band between them. There is also an unburnished decorative band flanked by grooves just above the belly of the pot.<br />The second pot (FIG. 10, B) seems to be in much the same fabric though it is darker on the surface and darker in the break. Details of the neck are missing. The turned and burnished areas overlap - as they were presumably intended to do - leaving only the single unburnished band around the belly; this is embellished with a burnished wavy line.<br />The general form of these vessels is best paralleled by a number of so-called handleless bottles from the Sandford kiln site (T. May, in Arch., LXXII (1921), 223-42), though the Sandford fabric is softer than these pieces. Hard, smooth-surfaced grey pottery like these two pieces is common in the region though not in dated contexts. Its use for containers for this coin hoard gives a firm date for its manufacture, in the second quarter of the 4th century.""<br />There followed a discussion whether pot A, containing the smaller, earlier part of the hoard was buried before the larger, later part, in pot B. If so, ""this would be an example of banking by burying, the careful saver having taken careful note of the position of his first hoard so that he was able to relocate it and add to it twenty years later.<br />And, from the way in which each hoard comes predominantly from a single mint, it looks as though he received his money en masse rather than by saving, perhaps as a gratuity, perhaps as pay."""" ******* Although the coins had been removed from their containers by the finder, it was evident from the metal stains that each pot had held different-sized coins. The coins were not separated out according to their containers in the catalogue, thought the split is said to have been chronological (with pre-330 coins in one jar and later ""and smaller"" coins in the other). The coins in the Ashmolean (catalogued) are thought to represent ""virtually the entire hoard"".

The hoard was discovered while workmen were removing a tree stump on a farm near Bicester in July 1979. The dislodgement of the stump resulted in the coins being scattered and they were recovered with the farmer's permission by means of a metal detector by Mr. P.A. Cartwright, Mr. G. Grimes and Mr. N. Grimes. Three hundred and eighty seven coins were recovered initially and an additional 53 coins were found on a return visit to the site a few days later. There was no sign of a container but this may have resulted from the manner of their discovery.

Some Roman sherds and two 4th-century coins - of the same class as those in the hoard itself - proved this gulley to be of Roman date.<br />It is clear, therefore, that the 7th-century grave-diggers happened accidentally to choose a part of the Iron Age site which had already been disturbed at the end of the Roman period and used for the concealment of a coin-hoard. Their grave was cut diagonally across the Roman gully and the coin hoard was scattered, some at least of the coins finding their way into the filling of the grave. Whether the majority of the coins had been retained by their finders, and whether the remaining 50 had been intentionally thrown back into the grave, it is difficult to say, but two points may be mentioned. First, seven coins including two not belonging to the hoard, were found in such close juxtaposition to the skeleton as to suggest that they had been deliberately placed on the corpse. Second, the coins found among the stones placed at the top of the grave were so close together and conspicuous that, in normal circumstances, they could hardly have been missed.

The actual findspot is uncertain now, but it lay about 600-700 yards NNE. of the villa, and just north of the hedge between Box Wood and Out Wood, on the property of Mr. Gaskell.<br />With the owner's kind consent the hoard was removed to the Ashmolean Museum for cleaning and examination. From the broken sherds which accompanied the hoard it may probably be inferred that the coins were contained in a pot and that this was broken at some time or other in the process of cultivation.

It consists of 1551 coins, nearly all being of the last issues of Constantine the Great and the first of his sons - i.e. the 'Gloria Exercitus' type with 2 stand. and with one: the majority are of the earlier type with 2 stand.. From issues before this there are only 8 coins of Constantine and Licinius and their sons, 2 of Tetricus, much worn, and 3 rough copies with radiate heads. Among the 'Gloria Exercitus' pieces there are 13 which can definitely be regarded as unofficial..<br />""This hoard suggests that copies were made from any official coins that were current, and circulated alongside of them.<br />""<br />A list was given of 5 ant., and 1546 AE.<br />J.G. Milne, in JRS, XXI (1931), 101, 104, 108f., some types, mints, and pl.

King.<br />""Milne's published account of the hoard's contents listed 1,551 coins. When the hoard was recatalogued 1,565 pieces were counted. It is uncertain whether the additional fourteen coins were part of the hoard or modern intrusions although in view of Milne's careful listing of the contents by period and by mint the latter seems more likely. Regrettably it is impossible on physical grounds to distinguish the extra coins which may have found their way into the hoard as none can be obviously excluded on the basis of wear, patina, etc. One can, however, thanks to Milne's method of recording the hoard, identify by mint and period the discrepancies between his totals and the new figures. Thus where Milne recorded five radiates, the hoard now has 6; and there are 10 more coins from Lyons than appear in his totals (which included the copies, listed by him as genuine issues). The totals from Arles, Rome, and Heraclea all have one more coin than Milne noted, Cyzicus has one less, and the remaining extra piece belongs in the group of uncertain mintmark.""<br />Cathy E.

A hole some 2m. in diameter was dug at the spot by Mr. Jones and members of his family, and this revealed two Roman earthenware vessels containing the bulk of the hoard. Several more coins scattered by the plough up to 10m. from the vessels were retrieved with the use of a metal detector. The coins, numbering some 4,102 were reported to Mr. K. Mason (then Curator of the Powysland Museum, Welshpool) in April 1982, and were brought to the National Museum of Wales for identification and study. Subsequently a further 614 scattered coins came to light and are included in the catalogue. Therefore, 4,716 coins have been identified, a total probably not far off the number originally buried.<br />The two earthenware containers were found buried just below the surface. The upper parts of both vessels had been disturbed by the plough, and sherds from these scattered.

M Curteis writes: The hoard contains coins ranging in date from radiates of the late 3rd Century to late 4th century Theodosian bronze issues. There are very few coins earlier in date than 383 while the latest issues were minted c.395-402. The hoard contains a single silver coin (a siliqua of Arcadius). Many of the Valentinianic coins are worn and have been cut down to a similar module as the Theodosian bronzes. It is probable that many of the earlier coins were in circulation, and became incorporated into the hoard, because they had a similar small module to that of the coinage of the late 4th century. The inclusion of a single silver coin is highly unusual and may indicate that the bronze coins were seen to have a monetary value at the time of deposition. The relative proportion of coins with reverse legend SALVS REIPVBLICAE (c.388-402), along with the presence of at least ten coins minted after c.395 would indicate that the hoard is very late, falling right at the end of the Romano-British coin sequence. It may be significant that the hoard was found c 1km further down the side of the Welland valley to another hoard, the Tinwell hoard (DCMS 2000, 118-9). Although the Tinwell hoard was somewhat earlier (having been deposited c 275) and was mainly composed of base-silver radiates (2829 radiates and one base-silver denarius), the proximity may not be accidental and raises the possibility that both hoards form part of a series of votive deposits on religious sites that concentrate in this area, perhaps symbolically marking the boundary between the Corieltauvi and Catuvellauni (Curteis 1996 and 2000).",52.64473,-0.5416,highest,PAS UK Finds,1/13/2015 11:57,12:05.8,9/1/2015 16:45,,"Curteis, M., 2009    Ketton, Rutland    Wetteren:"

    102Coin data quality rating: Excellent (Grade 4)Description18 radiates and 9297 nummi to 335.The 9,315 coins were contained in a broken ceramic jar and excavated by the finder. The subsequent archaeological excavation recovered a scatter of coins in the immediate area and some associated pottery sherds (from the jar). The pot had originally been placed in a pit and was covered by a large flat stone. Some evidence of prior disturbance (possibly due to animal or root action) was found, causing the coins to be scattered around the vessel. BNJ 2012, 38.Treasure numbers associated with this hoard: 2009 T450Other PAS records associated with this hoard: HESH-658701NotesEG writes: The internal stratigraphy of the pot suggests that the latest coins were added in a later deposition event, as they are only significantly present in the upper three layers and the scattered coins outside the pot. The earlier coins are distributed throughout the pot, as might be expected if these remained in circulation until the date of burial. Some mixing of the contents may be expected to have taken place due to the disturbance of the pot but the patterning is still clear.Subsequent actions

The 'reversed stratification' points to there having been well-demarcated periods of occupation or frequentation of the cave. Most of the numismatic material relates to counterfeiting but, as Mr. Barrett observes, there is nothing to prove that the counterfeits were actually produced on the spot. There are no crucibles from which metal was poured to make the little bars described: no debris of the clay moulds which must have been used: nothing resembling a die. It is his suggestion that the evidence of counterfeiting was merely concealed in the cave. On the other hand, such preliminary work as was required to produce the blanks may have done elsewhere, perhaps as part of a perfectly ordinary and legitimate bronze-smithing activity; and the dies might have been too precious to leave in the dampness of a cave.""<br />The material was classified as follows:<br />Itemised:<br />A.

Dickinson, Esq., M.P., communicated an account of a discovery of Roman coins recently made on his estate at King's Weston, Somersetshire, at a spot about a mile and a half from Somerton, on the London road, adjoining to the sites of two buildings supposed to have been Roman villas, in one of which a tesselated pavement exists . The recent discovery comprised about forty coins of the Lower Empire , as stated by Mr. Hassell of Littleton, who has carefully investigated the Roman remains in the neighbourhood of Somerton ; he also observed that the name Willem (vallum) had previously led him to make excavations near the spot where the coins were found, and many traces of ancient occupation were brought to light. The coins forwarded by Mr. Dickinson for the inspection of the Committee comprised a small brass coin, apparently of Constantius II., one of Gratian, struck at Siscia, in Pannonia, and one of Theodosius (?). In the Comb under Snap Hill, near to the place where these pieces were found, three stone cists were recently found containing skeletons in perfect preservation. They were deposited without any regularity of position, and the bodies had been enclosed with thin and rough slabs of the lias stone of the neighbouring hill, placed around them in an irregular manner. One skeleton only lay east and west, and no coins or other remains were found"".",50.97722,-2.7135,highest,PAS UK Finds,1/13/2015 11:57,13:12.9,5/14/2015 12:30,,"Robertson, A.S., 2000    An Inventory of Romano-British Coin Hoards    London:   357 no. 1467"

He was soon on the spot, and leaving most of those in the water where they had fallen, he gathered from the hole as many more as he could well carry. The villagers of Filton, who saw him, say he had a hundredweight. He himself acknowledges to having upwards of three hundred pieces.<br />He brought me two hundred as a sample; these were all oxidised, some of them very much so indeed, others were in beautiful condition. They are second and third brasses of great variety of type, most of them of the coinage of London and Treves. Amongst those which I examined there were none earlier than Licinius, or later than Constans I. Those of Constantine the Great were by far the largest number. It is evident that they have never been in circulation, those unaffected by the atmosphere being as sharp as though just brought from the Mint.<br />In addition to these, the finder informs me that there were a vast number of smaller coins, measuring from the one-eighth to three-eighths of an inch, of which he had none with him, not thinking them of any value; of these he declared there were many thousands.<br />Having shown him some which I procured a few years since from a hoard discovered at Filwood [i.e. the Whitchurch, 1869, Somerset hoard, no. 808] he recognised them instantly<br />they run very irregular in size and shape, but have the greater portion a crowned head on the obverse - it is in every case in these lesser coins a spiked or rayed crown, which is, I think, a symbol of a British emperor. I have long thought that these are specimens of emergency money of the British usurpers. The other coins from Filton have either the wreathed coronet or the helmeted head upon the obverse. I found both Licinius senior and junior, Crispus, Constantine II., and Constans, as well as the better-known Constantine the Great. The pot in which they were contained was broken, and many had previously been swept away in times of flood. It was of common ware, about three-eighths of an inch thick.<br />Since the visit of the finder to myself, I have had a great number brought to me by other parties; a farmer from the village brought me for inspection a number, which have since been picked up in the brook. He says, scores of villagers were there on Sunday, wading in the muddy stream, and all of them were successful in their groping. He estimates many hundreds as the produce of that kind of work on that day.""<br />-J.F. Nicholls, in PSA, (2), VIII (1879-81), 385-8<br />""The only coin in the hoard of any rarity, but in poor preservation, is the same as that described in Akerman's Catalogue, vol. ii, p. 246, - 'Obverse, a laureated head with cornucopia on the shoulder; inscription, POP. ROMANVS. Reverse, a bridge with towers at each end. In the field, CONS E. It is of the size of a quinarius.' The obverses and reverses of the other coins, including the wolf with Romulus and Remus, are very common.

Jones, of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, Filton House, Bristol, along with the following note:<br />""About forty years ago or so Mr. Jones' uncle was working on the company land near a stream that runs near the bottom of Filton Hill. He and another man who was working with him saw two youths throwing stones at a jar half concealed in the bank of the stream presumably to see who could break it first. They succeeded, and Mr. Jones' uncle saw the coins coming out of the broken jar and went with his friend to get them out of the stream before they became embedded too deeply in the soft soil of the bank. Apparently he did not notify any authority of the find but rather kept them as an interesting curiosity, and eventually after his death they were passed on to his nephew.""<br />The coins were all AE:<br />AE<br />Constantine I 2<br />Crispus 1<br />Constantine II, Caes. 2<br />Constantius II, Caes. 4<br />Constantinopolis 5<br />Urbs Roma 2<br />House of Constantine I 1<br /><br />17<br />(GLORIA EXERCITVS, 1 stand., b.)<br />In spite of an apparent discrepancy in the date of discovery, it seems possible that these 17 coins came from the hoard found in 1880."" ******* The original find is thought to have been about 300 ?

    3Coin data quality rating: Excellent (Grade 4)DescriptionIt seems likely that two separated periods of hoarding activity mixed together through ploughing action are represented in this case. The majority of the coins, the nummi and even the solitary radiate could represent a fourth century hoard. The two Antonine pieces seem too early to be related and are from roughly the time of the fantail brooch whose fragment was found at the same time.Treasure numbers associated with this hoard: 2012 T896Other PAS records associated with this hoard: SWYOR-74BE41Subsequent actions

The objects were dispersed over the field and many of the coins had been chipped or bent by the action of the plough. The initial discovery consisting of 123 coins, three rings and one spoon was submitted to the British Museum in November 1991 and declared Treasure Trove at an inquest on 29 April 1992. A second group of 30 coins was discovered on the same site in October 1992; while a third group of 16 coins and three fragments of spoons was discovered in October 1994. Both these additional groups were also treated as Treasure Trove. The latest coins in the hoard are siliquae of Arcadius and Honorius minted at Milan between AD 394 and 402.

It consists of 212 silver siliquae of the period 360 to 402 AD. Three facts however point to a rather later date of burial, perhaps as late as the decade 410-20, after the death of Constantine III. The first is the fact that 107 coins, over half of the find, are VIRTVS ROMANORVM pieces of Arcadius and Honorius from the mint of Milan, which were struck between 395 and 402 and are the latest siliquae to enter into circulation in Britain in any quantity. The second is the relatively high proportion of clipped coins (65 or 30.7%), and the third is the comparatively large number of contemporary forgeries (10) which are fairly scarce. R.A.G. Carson has argued that clipping, a phenomenon unique to Britain, does not become widespread until after the supply of new coin had dried up, after the downfall of Constantine III in 411.""<br />The 212 sil.

The finder, Eric Lawes, located the treasure on November 16, 1992, and together with the tenant farmer of the land, Peter Whatling, immediately reported the discovery to Suffolk County Council, the landowners. This prompt action enabled a team from the Suffolk Archaeological Unit, under the direction of Judith Plouviez, to carry out a controlled emergency excavation of the remainder of the deposit on November 17. This was completed on the same day, and the finds were collected and taken to the British Museum on the following day. The deposit was lifted in small context blocks, and the recording and detailed excavation was therefore completed under laboratory conditions in the Museum. The hoard was declared Treasure Trove at a Coroner's Inquest in Lowestoft on September 3, 1993. Because of the timely reporting of the find and the consequent immediate involvement of professional archaeologists, the hoard is effectively complete (a few coins may have been scattered in previous ploughing), and details of the manner in which the objects were packed and buried were observed and noted. Some of the more fragile silver items would have been unlikely to survive amateur excavation..<br />Britannia 1994, 165<br />Container<br />""The extent of the deposit and the presence of corroded iron fittings indicate that the valuables were packed inside a wooden box measuring some 60 x 45 x 30 cm. Small box-fittings in silver, namely two padlocks, a hinge, several angle-brackets and decorative rosette-shaped studs, plus about 150 pieces of bone inlay, all testify to the presence of smaller caskets within the outer chest. There are fragments from a carved pyxis of bone or ivory, and minute fragments of woven textile have also been preserved. A carefully packed and stacked set of five plain silver bowls bore traces not only of cloth but also of organic padding between the vessels, probably hay..<br />Britannia 1994, 165<br />Names<br />""Seven personal names appear on objects in the treasure, one of them ... on the bracelet belonging to Juliana. The name Aurelius Ursicinus is found no fewer than ten times, engraved and picked out in black niello on a matching set of ten spoons, five ligulae and five cochlearia. Several men named Ursicinus are known from historical sources, but it is not possible to say whether one of them is identical with the Ursicinus of the Hoxne treasure... In any event, the presence of a whole set of spoons belonging to this one named individual raises a strong possibility that the whole hoard may have belonged to him. Other names include Peregrinus, Faustinus and a woman's name, Silvicola, all on spoons..<br />Contents (a) Other objects<br />""These consist chiefly of gold jewellery and silver plate, tableware and toilet implements. Apart from the coins, the two principal classes of material in the Hoxne hoard consist of gold jewellery and small items of silver tableware such as spoons. There are twenty-nine pieces of jewellery in all, comprising six necklaces, three finger-rings, one elaborate chain ornament, and nineteen bracelets... Silver plate, namely eating and drinking utensils made of silver, was owned by most wealthy Roman families, and could include large and highly decorated dishes, salvers, bowls and jugs as well as small containers, spoons and ladles. The Hoxne treasure was buried in a wooden box which was too small to contain vessels like the Great Dish from the Mildenhall Treasure, with its diameter of nearly 60 cm. Instead, the Hoxne tableware comprises seventy-eight spoons - nearly doubling the total number of late-Roman silver spoons known from Britain - twenty ladles and a variety of other small items including personal toilet implements such as toothpicks and ear-cleaners..<br />R. Bland and C. Johns, The Hoxne Treasure, (1993), 19, 25<br />The objects may be summarised as follows:<br />Gold<br />1-10 Necklaces and rings<br />11-29 Bracelets<br />Silver<br />30-41 Vessels: tiger handle, vases, piperatoria, bowls<br />42-61 Ladles<br />62-140 Spoons (ligulae, cochlearia, transverse ligulae)<br />141-144 Strainer-funnel and strainers<br />145-153 Toilet utensils (toothpicks, ear-scoops etc.)<br />154-169 Box-fittings (locks, mounts/brackets, hinge)<br />170-184 Miscellaneous: (rosette studs, mount, hemispheres)<br />Organic (ivory/bone/wood)<br />185-340 Decorated ?ivory box, bone inlay pieces, wooden fittings<br />Miscellaneous<br />341-388 Iron nails and bindings<br />389-391 Wood/metal fragments (?from large chest)<br />392 Textile fragments<br />393-399 Late additions<br />Miscellaneous fragments, modern objects, sherds (?Medieval)<br />Organic samples<br />Contents (b) Coins<br />""In all, some 14,941 coins have been recovered of which 577 are gold, 14,340 silver and 24 bronze [the initial discovery of the bulk of the hoard was supplemented by subsequent discoveries of 11 solidi and 81 reduced siliquae in October 1993 and of 68 reduced siliquae in September 1994]. The gold coins are all solidi ... and they all post-date Valentinian I's reform of AD 365-8, most of them being made during the reigns of Arcadius and Honorius, between c. AD 394 and c. 405. These coins are in an excellent state of preservation and, because none of them was more than about fifty years old at the time when the hoard is likely to have been buried, they have seen very little wear. The base metal coins include twenty-four small bronze coins of the fourth century AD, but unfortunately most of them are so poorly preserved that precise identification is impossible..<br />""The great bulk of the coins are therefore made of silver. Most notably, there are sixty light miliarenses, which weigh around 4.2 grams. The Hoxne specimens include as many as five unpublished varieties. The oldest coin in the hoard is a very worn miliarensis of Constantine II (AD 337-40). Most of the silver coins, however, are siliquae: apart from two coins made before this denomination was reduced in weight in c. AD 358, the remaining 14,205 specimens are all made on the reduced standard of around two grams. Finally there are also four half-siliquae of Arcadius and Honorius and one anonymous half-siliqua. Apart from the one specimen of Constantine II, all the silver coins were minted within a period of fifty years, between c. AD 358 and 408..<br />Britannia 25, 1994, 165-6<br />""The find-spot is some four miles from the location where the Eye hoard of 650 gold coins of the same period was said to have been discovered in 1780 see no. 000). ""It remains a considerable coincidence that two finds containing over 500 solidi of the same period should have been made so close to each other and it seems at least possible that they might form two parts of the same deposit..<br />Britannia 25, 1994, 166<br />""The terminus post quem for the Hoxne hoard is fixed by the presence of two siliquae of the usurper Constantine III (AD 407-11) which may be dated to AD 407-8. However, the hoard's likely terminus ante quem is more difficult to establish ....This therefore leads to the controversial problem of clipping, and when exactly it occurred. Some 80 per cent of the siliquae in the Hoxne hoard are clipped around the edge, as are, unusually, 4 of the 60 miliarenses; a high proportion of clipped coins in a hoard is generally taken to indicate its late date....To sum up, therefore, I think it possible that such coins as the siliquae in the Hoxne hoard could have continued to circulate in Britain, in an ever deteriorating condition, for up to 20 or 30 years after Constantine III's death, maybe as late as the 440s, but this cannot be proven. The best terminus ante quem that the hoard can be given is between 407 and c. 450..<br />Britannia 25, 1994, 168<br /><br />1.

Rober Gwilt, the Lord of the Manor, who kindly placed them in my hands for examination. The precise number found is variously estimated, but it probably did not exceed four hundred.<br />The coins are all of silver, denarii and quinarii of the emperors of the latter part of the last century of the Roman rule in Britain. The majority are in a good state of preservation, and the metal untarnished; in several instances the coins are as brilliant as when first issued from the mint.<br />Of the vessel that contained them, the only portions recovered were the base, with its narrow foot and half the neck, representing a jar of about half a pint in capacity. It had evidently been broken some time previous to its final discovery; and fragments of it had, no doubt, been carried away in former ploughings, without materially disturbing the contents.<br />A visit to the spot, and a careful examination of the soil in the vicinity, resulted in the finding of four other coins, but no further fragments of the crock. The ground around however contained many small shards of different descriptions of pottery, from which I infer that the rising ground hereabouts was the site of dwelling-places during the Roman occupation; and that, beneath the floor of some hut or temporary dwelling, the small hoard was buried in some season of alarm, or for better safety during its owner's absence from home..<br />The coin of Valens, having the letters SPAK in the exergue, is of very rude workmanship, and the letters are upside down, closely following the reverse legend.<br />The proportion of denarii to quinarii is not easy to determine with any exactness, on account of the varying sizes and weights of the coins, and I do not attempt to distinguish them in the list. I may add, however, that the smaller coins would be, in proportion, about one fourth.""<br />Then came a list of 349 coins. ""The majority of the coins of Honorius are badly struck.""<br />H.

Upon digging, he found numerous pieces of money; some of which Miss Heyman herself saw; they were all Roman, and small silver coins. Among them were also found some plates or ornaments of silver, which the poor woman said she had shewn to two gentlemen, who called to see them; upon examining them, they told her they were of very considerable value, but that they could not say what their precise value might be, till they were taken to a silversmith, to be weighed and valued; this they offered to have done for her, and she unwisely trusted them to their care, but never afterwards saw either the men or the silver.<br />The fortunate discovery of this treasure made a considerable sum of money, by the sale of the coins, and purchasing the premises, built himself a new cottage, upon the site of the pigsty where they were found; and where he lived many years, and where, Miss Heyman believes, he still lives.""<br />Davy, Suffolk Coll.

The hoard was found in a field north of both the pressent and the former line of the A27 approximately 0.5 km south-west of the village of Patching, West Sussex. When the hoard was discovered the field was under rough pasture.... The twenty-three gold coins recovered by the metal-detectorists were found in three stages. The first sweep produced five coins. Subsequently, using a mini-digger, the metal-detectorists recovered a further seventeen gold coins, twenty-five silver coins, two heavy gold rings, and a quantity of silver bullion. Archaeological excavation revealed that three trenches had been dug by machine, at the request of the metal-detectorists, to a depth of nearly 0.5m. A final gold coin was subsequently found by the metal detectorists after the archaeological excavation had been completed.... Excavation revealed no original context for the coin and bullion hoard. The discovery of two field-drains below the main concentration of coins suggests that the hoard may have been disturbed by one, or both, of the operations to set these drains.... The following sequence can therefore be suggested: (1) Original deposition of the hoard in unknown receptacle or pit. (2) The construction of the nineteenth-century field-drain disturbs the concentrated hoard, with artefacts redeposited during backfilling. (3) The scattered hoard is disturbed a second time by the laying of the later field-drain, once again with redepositing occurring during backfilling. (4)Upper layers disturbed by excavations by metal-detectorists... The nineteenth-century disturbance of the hoard could have resulted in the discovery of two of the solidi which then appeared later in Chichester [see single finds, Chichester]. AD 367-75 (1)<br />1.

The site lies on the farm of the Messrs. Thomas, west of a small, deep valley known as Pant y Coed, at Llanbethery, a hamlet of Llancarfan parish in the Vale of Glamorgan, near Barry. Traces of a Roman building have since been noted nearby (Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies, XVII (1958), 294, and fig. 1).<br />The upper part of the vessel, and an unknown number of coins, had evidently been ploughed off during the fourteen years or so in which the very poor field concerned has been cultivated. The yellow clay and stone forming the surface of the bedrock lies only a few inches below ground-level, and the pot was buried upright in a small hollow scooped in the subsoil. In all, 814 coins were recovered, 767 of them in the pot. Sundry other coins are in private hands, but it is not very likely that they would alter the picture now presented. Except for six worn 'radiates', the coins fall within the period c. AD 313-46, and mainly between 330-5. There are very few later than 335, and it seems reasonable to suppose that they were added to the collection when it was to be buried.""<br />The 814 coins were 6 ant., and 808 small AE:<br />Ant.

In the one there was nothing but some ashes: the other was full of medals, set edglong as full as it could be thrust. My man judging it only to be of that Copper money which they find so oft about the town, set it carefully upon the ground by him: and the Town, consisting of Knitters, some of them coming to see the Work, picked out some pieces of this money: at last one brought in a piece to me, which upon tryal I found to be silver and thereupon sent for the pot into my House.<br />In the midst whereof I found 16 pieces of gold, as bright as if they had been lately put in, and about 800 pieces of Silver, and yet no two of them alike, and the latest of them above 1400 years old. They contained the whole History of the Roman Empire from Julius Caesar till after Constantine the Great's time.

Gauntlett while removing a field boundary bank less than 100 m due E of Chisbury Camp in Little Bedwyn. The hillfort was investigated in 1932 by Mrs M.E. Cunnington, when a reservoir and connecting trenches were dug inside it, but no late Roman finds were then made. Roman finds have been made either in or near the fort on other occasions. Chronologically the latest, however, apart from this hoard, is a late 3rd-century antoninianus of the empress Salonina.<br />The coins were in an extremely poor state of preservation, so much so that two-thirds of them were completely illegible. The reverse type could just be made out on the other 33 coins, but in no case was it possible to read the mint mark, and only in five cases was it possible to establish the emperor of the obverse. Consequently the attached list is not at all detailed.<br />The bulk of the hoard seems to have consisted of the SALVS REIPVBLICAE and VICTORIA AVGG(G) coins minted between 388 and 402; these were also the latest coins in the hoard, whose deposition can, therefore, be placed in around AD 400."":<br />AE CONSTANTINOPOLIS 1<br />VRBS ROMA 1<br />VICTORIAE DD AVGGQ NN 4<br />FEL TEMP REPARATIO, falling horseman 1<br />SPES REIPVBLICE 1<br />GLORIA ROMANORVM 2<br />SECVRITAS REIPVBLICAE 1<br />Valentinian II 2<br />Arcadius 2<br />Arcadius or Honorius 1<br />""Theodosian"" 82<br />SALVS REIPVBLICAE 8<br />VICTORIA AVGG(G) 9<br />""probably SALVS REIPVBLICAE<br />or VICTORIA AVGGG"" 65<br />frag. 1<br /><br />99<br />(SALVS REIPVBLICAE or VICTORIA AVGG(G))<br />A.M.

Greenaway of Reading Museum), added that the hoard contained 1,800 fourth century coins, and that Matthewsgreen was on the north-west outskirts of Wokingham.<br />""Circumstances of discovery<br />The first few coins from the Wokingham hoard were discovered on 20th May 1970 by Mrs P Prime when exercising her dogs in a ploughed field at Matthewsgreen Farm on the north-eastern edge of Wokingham. Subsequently, a more thorough surface search by Mr and Mrs Prime later that evening revealed more coins. On 21st May, 141 coins and 5 sherds of pottery with green corroded material adhering to the inner surfaces were brought to Reading Museum for identification. On 26th May, further coins, making a total of 271 in all, and more sherds, including one with a coin-shaped corroded stain on its interior surface, were deposited at the Museum. It was immediately apparent that the coins and some of the sherds were part of a hoard deposited in a pottery vessel which had been broken and some of its contents scattered by the plough a small excavation was undertaken to recover the rest of the scattered coins and sherds, and, if possible, to locate the remainder of the vessel and its contents. To ensure that no coins or other small metal objects were missed, the sieved soil from the excavation was spread on a plastic dustbin-lid and tested for metal using a metal detector. The bottom part of the pot was located the same day still containing a large proportion of the coins A total of 1610 whole coins, 3 coins in two pieces and a small strip of bronze were found The deposition of coins in the pot seems to have been fairly random: coins of different types and emperors are distributed amongst the stratification of the hoard within the beaker as outlined above. There was no deposition of coins by date, type and emperor. The small strip of bronze was found in the pot..<br />The hoard consisted of the following:<br />Ruler Regular % Counterfeit %<br />Constantius II 125 9.94 46 12.92<br />Constans 202 16.07 49 13.77<br />Vertranio 1 0.08 0<br />Magnentius 793 63.09 234 65.73<br />Decentius 135 10.74 26 7.30<br />Constantius Gallus 1 0.08 1 0.28<br />Total 1257 356<br />Jillian A.

2274,IARCH-60A943,PAS: Cleeve Prior 2274,,,hoard,excav,,3600,1811.0,1811.0,"Robertson 2000, 397-398 no. 1600:""""Roman Coins. On Saturday night a man who was employed in getting stone out of a quarry at Cleeve Prior, near Evesham, discovered two large earthen pots, which, on examination, he found contained a considerable quantity of coins. He was, of course, greatly overjoyed at the discovery, but having got possession of the idea that the Lord of the Manor would lay claim to the treasure, he refused to tell the quantity of pieces he had found; however, he has disposed of a few which are in the hands of gentlemen in Evesham and neighbourhood. They prove to be gold and silver coins of several Roman Emperors. The gold coins are of the Emperors Valerian [sic], one of the Valentinians, Gratian, and Theodosius. It is scarcely possible to imagine their excellent state of preservation; they appear as if they had just been issued from the mint, not the minutest mark being obliterated, though from 14 to 1500 years have elapsed since they were coined, and, what is very interesting to the antiquarian, counterfeits were discovered among them executed in a most excellent manner, being copper plated with gold. The silver coins are those of Constantius, Julian, Valentinian, Gratian, and Theodosius; these were not in so good a state of preservation as the gold. The execution of these coins is, of course, not very good, the art of cutting the dies being at that period very much upon the decline. The man has acknowledged that he found 100 of the gold ones; the silver ones most probably greatly exceeded that number.""<br />Berrow's Worcester Journal, 31 Oct. 1811; copied in Cheltenham Chronicle, 7 Nov. 1811; abbreviated in Shrewsbury Chronicle, 8 Nov. 1811 copy supplied, 1979, by E.J. Priestley, Clive House Museum, Shrewsbury<br />""I send you an account of the discovery of two earthen pots, the one containing gold, and the other silver Roman coins; found by a labourer while digging in a quarry at Prior's Cleeve, about five miles from Evesham, Worcs., on the 22nd. of October last.<br />The pots are of red earthenware, and I am informed are about 18 inches wide and about the same height; they were full of coins which poured out from the pot when broken by the stroke of the pickaxe.<br />The quantity of gold coin was as much as the fortunate discoverer could carry home at twice. They are of very pure gold, in the most perfect state of preservation, but amongst them are several of copper plated with gold. The silver coins are worn and appear to have been in circulation..<br />The pots stood upon stone of 8 inches in depth, in a stratum of clay of 18 inches: over the pots was placed stone of 4 inches in depth and above that, the natural soil 16 inches in depth from the surface.""<br />Then came a description of gold coins of Valentinian I (3); Gratian (1); Valentinian II (1); and Theodosius (1): silver coins of Constantius II (1); Julian (3); Valentinian I (2); Gratian (1); Valentinian II (1); Theodosius (2).<br />Gent. Mag. 81, II, 1811, II, 505f., types, mints<br />Annual Register, 6 Nov. 1811, 125, and R.F. Tomes, in Berrow's Worcester Journal, 27 June 1891, gave rather diffuse accounts of the find.<br />J. Brandish, 4 June 1812, in Ms. Min. Soc. Ant., XXXIII (1811-17), 148, and E. Rudge, in Arch., XVII (1814), 329f., gave brief accounts, with types of 2 sil. of Gratian and Magnus Maximus.<br />Gent. Mag., 1814, I, 86, and G. May, Hist. of Evesham (1834), 244 n., gave very brief accounts, the latter, however, adding that the silver coins were ""of the reign of Constantine<br />"" [possibly of Constantius II].<br />BM Mss. Add. 33661, 27 Aug. 1815, also gave a brief account, but did mention 1 AV of Valentinian (I?), and 2 sil. of Gratian and Maximus.<br />Prattinton's Ms. Vol. VII (in Library of Soc. Ant., London) preserved several lists of small collections of coins from the Cleeve Prior hoard.<br />After referring to several of the previous accounts, J. Allies, The ancient British, Roman, Saxon Antiquities and folk-lore of Worcs.., 2 ed. (1852), 91-4, continued:<br />""Rev. R.D. Stillingfleet, Vicar of Cleeve Prior, in answer to some inquiries I made respecting the coins, stated that Thomas Sheppey, the man who found them in the first instance, conveyed them secretly to his own house; that he afterwards took them to the Dean and Chapter of Worcester, (Lords of the Manor), who, after reserving a few of the coins, returned him the remainder..<br />I have seen some of the coins in the possession of Rev. Allen Wheeler, of Worcester, and Rev. Wm. Brown, of Bredicot; in addition to some of the above [i.e. those described in earlier accounts] they have coins of Valerian, D.N.Fl. Victor and Gordianus Pius.<br />Sheppey stated that a goat's head was found in the excavation, which was perhaps a votive offering made upon depositing the coins.<br />After writing the above, I went to Cleeve Prior, and saw at the Rev. Mr. Stillingfleet's, in addition to those previously mentioned, a gold coin of Arcadius, and two silver coins, one of Vespasian, and another which I could not decipher. T. Sheppey, the finder of the urns and coins, informed me that the quantity of gold coins found in one of the urns (which would hold about two quarts) amounted to about six lbs. in weight; that there were about 3000 silver coins in the other urn, which would contain about a gallon; that the goat's head was found four or five yards from the urns, about four feet deep, in a cavity made in the quarry, which cavity was of the shape of a basin at the bottom; that he was offered £700 for the coins, which he refused; that he considered they were worth about £1000 but could not tell the total amount received for them, they having been sold in parcels at various times.<br /><br />the late Rev. Mr. Digby, Canon of Worcester Cathedral, informed me that one of the urns also contained gold coins of Valens, Magnus Maximus, and Arcadius, and he gave me an account of 255 of the gold coins and of 832 of the silver coins.""<br />F. Haverfield, in VCH Worcs., I (1901), 216f. (cp. VCH Worcs. 3 (1913), 308 n.2) observed:<br />""The gold coins included issues of Valentinian I and II, Valens, Gratian, Theodosius and Arcadius. The finder declared that in total they weighed 6 lb, and, if we assume they resembled the ordinary gold coins of the period, they must have numbered between 550 and 600 if the man reckoned by avoirdupois, as a labourer would probably do, or between 450 and 500 if he reckoned by the troy weight usually employed for precious metals. Canon Digby of Offenham gave Mr. Allies an account of 255 of these, but it has not survived. The gold coins are said to have been in singularly good preservation and for the most part to have consisted of very pure gold, but some were only plated copper. This last statement may however be an error, for the gold coinage of the 4th century was almost uniformly pure, and as its value depended largely on its weight, forgeries were necessarily difficult.<br />The silver coins of the hoard included issues of Constantius II, Julian, Valens, Valentinian I, Gratian, Magnus Maximus, Theodosius, and Honorius, with, according to Mr. Allies, one coin of Vespasian. They were stated by the finder to number about 3,000; of 832 Canon Digby gave Mr. Allies an account. The silver coins were, it is said, much more worn than the gold as indeed one might expect. Mr Allies and Mr. May add that the hoard also comprised coins of Gordian, Valerian, Constantine, Valens and Flavius Victor, but they do not mention the metals. Let me further point out that at the Worcestershire Exhibition of 1882 the late Canon A.H. Winnington Ingram, rector of Harvington near Cleeve Prior, exhibited coins from the hoard and an object described in the 'Catalogue' (p. 53) as 'a Roman lady's bronze chatelaine found at Cleeve Prior'. I do not know whether this has anything to do with the hoard nor can I discover what has become either of the coins or the 'chatelaine'.""<br />B.H.St.J. O'Neil, in NC, 1936, 314-16, discussed the previous accounts, and also the information preserved in the Haverfield Mss. (now in the Haverfield Library, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). The presence of coin(s) of Honorius in the hoard is established by a letter from G.L. Eades, 10 May 1901, to Haverfield.<br />The most engaging account of the discovery is in E.A.B. Barnard, Evesham and Four Shires Notes and Queries, II, 1911-14, 219-21.<br />7 sil. from the Cleeve Prior hoard were in the Caerleon Museum (now in NMW, Cardiff) They were said to be of Constantius II (1); Magnentius [sic] (1 VIRTVS ROMANORVM TRPS); Julian II (1); Valentinian II (2), Magnus Maximus (1); Flavius Victor (1). (J. Lee, Isca Silurum (1862), 81f.)<br />B.H.St.J. O'Neil gave a minimum list of coins recorded in the various early accounts (omitting, however, Arcadius): AV AR TOTAL<br />Constantius II 10 10<br />Julian II 12 12<br />Valentinian I 2 7 9<br />Valens 15 15<br />Gratian 1 11 12<br />Valentinian II 1 5 6<br />Theodosius 1 6 7<br />Magnus Maximus 12 12<br />Flavius Victor 1 1<br />Honorius 1 1<br /><br />5 80 85<br />Other emperors mentioned in connection with the hoard (Vespasian, Gordian III, Valerian and Constantine, the last probably a mistake for Constantius II) must either have been wrongly identified, or have been intruders from other source.<br />Cathy E. King, in BNJ, 51 (1981), 16, appeared to give the nos. of coins in the Cleeve Prior, 1811 hoard as c. 3000 sil. and 100 half-sil.<br />Cp. G.C. Boon, in Coins and the Archaeologist (1988), 186, pl.

A boy thrust his hand into the jar and found a great number of what he thought to be gun wads. On the arrival of some of the men the wads were thought to be spade guineas. A general scramble ensued, some filling their caps, others their dinner bags. On examination it was found that the jar was a beautiful Roman one, in a state of good preservation, and that it contained 6 stones, or 84 lbs. avoirdupois of Roman coins, some of them well preserved, and judging from their design, make, and finish of a high antiquity.<br />Under what circumstances this wonderful great treasure was deposited it is difficult to conjecture."" Some of the coins were of Constantius and Magnetius [sic].<br />Malton Messenger, 23 Oct. 1858; transcript supplied, Jan. 1953, by Malton Gazette, formerly Malton Messenger, through Miss Ivy Hill, Castleford Library and Museum, and Miss Amy G. Foster, Librarian and Archivist, Yorks. Arch. Soc.<br />At a meeting of the East Riding Antiquarian Society at Driffield, on 4 April 1905, the Rev. E. Maule Cole gave a paper on Roman coins found in the wolds. After dealing with the find at Nunburnholme in 1855, he continued:<br />""Another famous 'find' was that at Cowlam in 1859 [sic], where an immense vase was unearthed by lads at the plough, who filled their pockets with the coins, abandoned their work, and said that they meant to live like gentlemen. In proof of this, Mr. Cole had secured the presence of an old man named Hotham, who was acting as foreman on the Cowlam farm, and was ploughing when the treasure was turned up. Hotham, a veteran of seventy-eight years, hale and hearty, and evidently delighted to be present, stood up, and in reply to Mr. Cole, said there were twelve lads present. 'They all wanted some in their pockets' he added, 'and I took all I could get hold of for my master. It was about half past three in the afternoon, and you should have seen the lads reaching ower the pankin and scramping the money in'. Mr. Cole: 'They meant for the future to live as gentlemen?' Hotham: 'Ay, that they did. They said, ""We'll nivver wark na mair! (Laughter) and they brak off a lump of the pankin in getting it up'. Mr. Cole (proceeding) said the lads had to hand over their spoil, and 10,256 coins were sent to a dealer in London. From him Mr. Christopher Sykes purchased 100 for Mr. Mortimer, and they were in his museum. None were purchased by the British Museum, though some might have found their way since then into the national collection.""<br />F. Haverfield, in Antiquary, XLI (1905), 196; cp. Rev. E. Maule Cole, in Globe, 24 May 1905, and Trans. East Riding Ant. Soc., XIV (1907), 6f.<br />J.R. Mortimer, Forty Years' Researches in British and Saxon Burial Mounds of E. Yorks. (1905), lxxxiii, 199, 338, described the urn as ""a large black vase"", and said that it contained 1400 bronze coins.<br />In Literary Gazette, 27 Aug. 1859, 213, P. Whelan, the dealer, gave a list of 9256 coins from this hoard, which were left in his possession after Mr. C. Sykes had bought 100 for J.R. Mortimer. Rev. E. Maule Cole gave a list of Mortimer's 100 coins in Trans. East Riding Ant. Soc., XIV (1907), 6. Now, in Hull City Museum, are 88 out of Mortimer's 100 coins, which were acquired by the Museum with the Mortimer collection at Driffield.<br />Examined 88 coins in Hunterian Museum, 1938 (ASR)<br />The two lists of 9256 and 100 coins are set alongside one another and added together.

2362,IARCH-35AE4E,PAS: Heslington 2362,,,hoard,,,2862,1966.0,1966.0,"Robertson 2000, 333-334 no. 1366:""""A hoard of some 2,800 Roman bronze coins of the fourth century AD contained in a broken storage jar, was found by workmen on 1 March 1966, a little to the south-east of College 3, then being constructed for York University on the south-west facing slope of Heslington Hill and about 800 feet south-east of the mound called on the modern Ordnance Survey maps 'Siward's House'. Before the construction work the site had been park land but displayed the ridge and furrow of earlier ploughing, and 18 inches of plough soil containing bone, brick, and oyster shell overlay the place where the pot was found. Below the plough soil was natural clay into which the pot had been set, but the high water table made it impossible to examine the clay immediately around the pot. The bottom of the pot was approximately 3 feet below the present surface, which roots of turf still showing in the mud proved at this point to have been as yet unaltered by levelling operations. The pot was removed by workmen but they were able to point out the exact spot, and the shape of the pot base could still be felt in the clay under the water..<br />The jar containing the hoard had evidently been broken up by ploughing but enough pieces remained to provide a complete section of the pot (Fig. 1, drawing by L.J. Keen). The fabric is a hard grey; dark grey externally and the core light grey. The rim is simply outcurved and with the neck burnished. Immediately below the neck and between the two deeply sunk handles is an unburnished zone scored with single loops. Below a burnished zone is another unburnished, scored with vertical lines. The rest of the pot, to the flat base, is smoothed..<br />Apart from two third-century Antoniniani of Tetricus I and Tacitus and some 200 small bronzes of the Constantinian dynasty between 317 and 348 the hoard was composed of the type of bronze coinage first introduced by Constantius II and Constans in 348 or by Magnentius and Decentius between 350 and 353. As the hoard contains only two coins of Julian as Caesar, it must have been closed and concealed shortly after the appointment of Julian in 355.<br />""<br />The hoard was said to include only 1,158 regular issues, but in fact a total of 1208 were catalogued. There were also 1287 irregular copies of AE, plus 297 overstruck copies, and ""one further example of 'Censeris' and two more of 'Carausius II'. None of these appears to be from the same dies as any of the specimens heretofore published.""<br />The total no. of coins catalogued was 2795.<br />R.A.G. Carson and J.P.C.

2367,IARCH-209573,PAS: Thirsk Area 2367,,,hoard,,,10,1996.0,1998.0,"Between April 1996 and January 1998, [the finder] deposited at the Yorkshire Museum a number of late Roman coins which he discovered with the aid of a metal detector at a site located near Thirsk in North Yorkshire. The coins, comprising three gold solidi and six silver siliquae (one being a contemporary counterfeit), were scattered over an area of several hundred square feet. No trace of any associated container was recovered. The earliest coin recovered is the a siliqua of Constantius II, issued c.AD 353-55. With the exception of a cliche imitation siliqua in the name of Gratian (AD 367-83), all the other coins can be attributed to the reigns of Arcadius (AD 383-408) and his brother and co-emperor Honorius (AD 393-423). Of these the latest coin struck is the Ravenna mint solidus of Honorius, which was issued c.AD 402-06. All of the coins are of types which would have been in circulation at the time of the withdrawal of direct Roman rule from Britain in AD 410. Indeed the four of the officially issued siliquae (# 6-9) are badly clipped, suggesting a date of deposit for those coins of AD 410 or slightly later. The archives of the Yorkshire Museum record the donation to the museum in 1834 of a gold solidus of Honorius (#3) found on the same site .This raises to four the number of late Roman gold coins from the site, and suggests that the coins under consideration may well represent survivors from a hoard which had been initially disturbed by 1834. The wide distribution of the coins may well accordingly be the result of 150 years of ploughing and natural soil erosion, a suggestion supported by the clear evidence of plough damage visible on two of the three solidi recovered by Mr Charlton. The coins found [...] were declared to be Treasure Trove at an inquest held in Richmond on 18 February 1998 and were subsequently acquired by the Yorkshire Museum. ******* Images in C&amp;M The 1834 solidus was included in the published hoard catalogue although it is not known whether the provenance was given to the museum beyond the parish level.

The leather immediately mouldered away on exposure to the atmosphere; and the silver urn, which glittered at the first disclosure to the air, assumed an earthy hue; or, as the boy himself expressed it 'all eazed [i.e. decayed] away together'. The Urn is said to have been broad like a bason with an ornamented circular edge turned downwards. The whole treasure weighed two stone. Most of this treasure was soon after transmitted to the lawful owner, the Earl of Aylesbury, on whose estate the discovery was made. Of the silver ornaments, I can, therefore, speak with no certainty. The spoon had a very short inverted handle, and was deep and broad; when perfect, apparently about an inch and a half in length, and near an inch broad. One of the bars of silver was three inches long, three-fourths of an inch broad, and three-eighths thick; the surface very irregular and apparently hammered. Many of the coins towards the top of the Urn (which was, I believe, open) had mouldered into dust, and the ground was actually tinged with a blue colour where they had lain; those in the interior were many of them very perfect; all those I have seen were of the Lower Empire, and of the following emperors: Constantius, Julian, Valentinian, Valens, Gratian, Valentinian the younger, Theodosius, Magnus Maximus, Eugenius, Arcadius, and Honorius. There were no uncommon reverses; but I saw some double denarii, and one of Eugenius. I saw altogether in different hands about 150 coins, chiefly well-preserved, but several of them clipped at the edge.<br /><br />The above account was communicated to me chiefly by the Rev. Wm.

Kapel, Leeds University, and which proved to have a powdered limestone base with traces of silicates, chloride, phosphate, and iron which probably gives the colouring.

A variety of western mints are represented, though there is a clear bias towards the nearer mints of London, Trier and Lyon. There are only a few coins from the eastern mint of Sisica. The final coins of the group were produced between AD 316 and AD 317.Treasure detailsTreasure case tracking number: 2012T652

Report by Steve Critchley: The hoard itself comprised a dispersed scatter of 38 coins from the lower fills of a pit, 339, on the northern margin of the pond (Figs 5 &amp; 6, Section 15; Table 6). These were also in poor condition, and only eight can be specifically attributed. They range in date from a coin of Constantine I (330-346) to coins of Valens (364-378). This suggests that the hoard was probably deposited at some time in the 370s AD, but it contained some issues 30-40 years old at the time.

2899,IARCH-F12660,PAS: Blyford 2899,,,hoard,,,9,2008.0,2008.0,"Roman coin hoard: Nine 3rd-4th century coins fused together. The coins have been burnt, with some charcoal adhering to the corrosion products. The coins are visible in two stacks, one of the stacks has considerably more damage due to burning. Four coins are clearly visible in one stack, with one face exposed. No detail is visible on the exposed coin face - there is possibly a radiate crown, however this is uncertain due to the level of corrosion. The exposed coin has a diameter of 13.24mm. The amount of coins on the second stack is more difficult to assertain due to the fused and melted condition. This area appears to have four coins stacked on top of each other with corrosion products inbetween, a further coin joins the two stacks together. The remaining area of corrosion contains fragments of coins, however due to the burnt condition it is unclear whether these are part of the coins listed above, or are additional coins. It weighs 12.74 grams.<br />Other PAS records associated with this hoard: ESS-962187 ******* Comment on PAS database: Conservator Emma Hogarth of Colchester &amp; Ipswich Museum Service does not believe that an x-ray will provide any more information about the coins / number of coins. As we can only be certain of 9 coins, this group does not qualify as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996), as 10 or more base metal coins need to be present. It is quite likely that these are either barbarous coins or blanks to be used for making barbarous coins. Such groups have been found before, for example at Lacock in Wiltshire where c. 15 such peices were found fused together.

    9Coin data quality rating: Poor (Grade 1)DescriptionRoman coin hoard: Nine 3rd-4th century coins fused together. The coins have been burnt, with some charcoal adhering to the corrosion products. The coins are visible in two stacks, one of the stacks has considerably more damage due to burning. Four coins are clearly visible in one stack, with one face exposed. No detail is visible on the exposed coin face - there is possibly a radiate crown, however this is uncertain due to the level of corrosion. The exposed coin has a diameter of 13.24mm. The amount of coins on the second stack is more difficult to assertain due to the fused and melted condition. This area appears to have four coins stacked on top of each other with corrosion products inbetween, a further coin joins the two stacks together. The remaining area of corrosion contains fragments of coins, however due to the burnt condition it is unclear whether these are part of the coins listed above, or are additional coins. It weighs 12.74 grams.Other PAS records associated with this hoard: ESS-962187NotesComment on PAS database: Conservator Emma Hogarth of Colchester & Ipswich Museum Service does not believe that an x-ray will provide any more information about the coins / number of coins. As we can only be certain of 9 coins, this group does not qualify as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996), as 10 or more base metal coins need to be present. It is quite likely that these are either barbarous coins or blanks to be used for making barbarous coins. Such groups have been found before, for example at Lacock in Wiltshire where c. 15 such peices were found fused together. Image on PAS.Subsequent actions

Aspects of the find give cause to suspect that this may have been buried in modern times but it is included here as it has been published as a Roman hoard elsewhere. ******* R. Abdy was of the opinion that Groups 2 and 3 looked like a typical field scatter of site coins. This and the fact that there were few Theodosian issues as well as the composition of group 1 suggested that the hoard may not have been buried in Roman times. However it is also possible that the Theodosian issue was a stray find. I. Caruana and D. Shotter report that all the detected coins were in root-disturbed soil containing modern glass and pottery, although they suggest that the hoard may have been disturbed when the trees were first planted.

The first group may well be complete, but the second group is almost certainly too small since no coin was included unless it had all the necessary characteristics. One point that makes the second hoard almost certain is the lack of wear on these coins of Valentinian I and his co-rulers.

    14DescriptionRoman settlement at Rowler Manor Estate first recorded in 1991 during archaeological watching brief, when Roman pottery & two coin hoards were recovered. Later investigation revealed stone building remains & 4th C. mosaic floor. APs suggest this just one of many buildings in much larger complex over 5ha in extent.During excav. in 2002, demolition layers removed from Room C, & comprised silty sand, mortar, limestone frags., stone & ceramic tile frags. & charcoal. Within context 12 were 14 coins of Constantinopolis to Constantius II & House of Constantine.Guest, P. 2008. The Roman coins. In M.

3251,IARCH-C1C022,PAS: Salford Priors 3251,,,hoard,excav,,96,1993.0,1994.0,"Excavations in advance of A435 Norton Lenchwick bypass, now part of A46. In Area C3, rectangular stone Building i was aligned E-W &amp; 15 x 7m in size, with clay bonded walls with loosely dressed faces. Inside Building i there was a large deep cess pit 329, into which stone slab floor partly subsided, but it was not clear if this was from an early phase of building, or a phase pre-dating it. There was a soil-filled hollow to E. To S was Building j, of aisled posthole construction &amp; timber form, at least 16 x 6m in size, with a central drain gullly. These 2 structures may have been agric. buildings assoc. with a larger complex - Building j could have been a byre. During excav., however, controlled metal detecting &amp; archaeol. recording around the two buildings plotted concs. of coins &amp; brooches, with a particular focus on the NE corner of Building i, but also with groups to the N 7 SE; &amp; to the E of Building j. The coins &amp; brooches were sometimes individual but also in groups of c. 10-16 coins, which in several cases were spatially close to brooch finds. The coins &amp; brooches were sometimes in soil layers, sometimes in very shallow 'scoops' in underlying natural subsoil. Some brooches were broken, others complete; &amp; between Buildings i &amp; j were 2 human skull frags.Mays, M. 2000. Roman coins. In S.C. Palmer Archaeological Excavations in the Arrow Valley, Warwickshire. Birmingham &amp; Warwickshire Archaeol. Soc/ Highways Agency, pp. 84-87, 126-134. ******* This record relates to a group of hoards and should perhaps be split. However it is possible that this deposition happened in spatially separate areas but at the same time, over an extended long period.In Mays' coin report in the excavation volume (pp. 126-134), Mays identifies 9 groups of third and fourth century coins (A-I) from Area C3 that were found in dense scatters over radius of c. 0.15m. It is suggested by Mays that these might be votive deposits, or alternatively hoards, but she suggests that only 4 of these scatters would fit conventional ideas of a hoard, due the larger than usual number of radiates, so the former explanation is more likely. She comments that ""the spatial distributions of neither the broken nor the unbroken brooches corresponds to that of the coins"". However the figure (Fig. 55) seems to suggest otherwise. She does link the human skull fragments to this deposition.The coin groups are: Scatter A - 16 coins to AD 364-378; Scatter B - 9 coins to AD 388-393; Scatter C - 16 coins to AD 388-402; Scatter D - 13 coins to AD 367-378; Scatter E - 4 disparate coins to AD 367-375; Scatter F - 9 coins to AD 367-378; Scatter G - 5 coins to AD 364-375; Scatter H - 5 coins to AD 337-341; &amp; Scatter I 6 coins to AD 341-348.
