A man named William Currell was engaged in the search for water, and his spade struck upon a pewter or white metal vessel, not more than five or six inches below the surface, which had already been broken into several pieces. It was, however, dug out from the ground, and was found to contain no less than 1496 silver coins, some cast silver ingots that had been cut into strips, and a silver ring set with an intaglio. The vessel has, so far as possible, been restored to its original form.It may be described as bottle-shaped. In height it is about 9? inches, and 7 inches in greatest diameter, the base being 4 inches across. Since the woodcut was made, the neck of the vessel, about 1? inches in length, has been found by Mrs. Kettlewell. It is about 1? inches inside diameter, and shows traces of there having been a handle to the vessel..The silver ring, of which also a woodcut is given, is of a not uncommon character, with the gem - a carnelian - projecting a considerable distance beyond the socket in which it is mounted. It presents the flattened oval opening for the finger so common in Roman rings. The gem has a figure of Mars bearing a trophy and spear engraved in intaglio upon it..The pieces of cast silver are five in number, not counting a small fragment, which has probably been broken off from one of them. One is a small lenticular cake about 1? inch in diameter, which seems to have been run into a depression in clay or sand. It has an indentation from a chisel on its upper surface. Its weight is 516 grains.Two of the other pieces are portions of another and large flat cake of silver about 2? inches in diameter, which has been cut into three by means of two parallel cuts with a chisel. Only the middle strip, which is about 5/8 inch wide, was present, and one of the outside segments. These weigh 248 and 806 grains respectively.The other two pieces are segments of cakes of the same character; one of them about 2? inches long and 1 inch broad in the middle, weighs 818 grains; the other 2? inches long and ? inch in extreme breadth, weighs 644 grains.

It seems to me to be interesting for two matters (1) the absence of any coins of 375-378, and (2) the fact that none of the coins are clipped to a smaller size.

He was soon on the spot, and leaving most of those in the water where they had fallen, he gathered from the hole as many more as he could well carry. The villagers of Filton, who saw him, say he had a hundredweight. He himself acknowledges to having upwards of three hundred pieces.He brought me two hundred as a sample; these were all oxidised, some of them very much so indeed, others were in beautiful condition. They are second and third brasses of great variety of type, most of them of the coinage of London and Treves. Amongst those which I examined there were none earlier than Licinius, or later than Constans I. Those of Constantine the Great were by far the largest number. It is evident that they have never been in circulation, those unaffected by the atmosphere being as sharp as though just brought from the Mint.In addition to these, the finder informs me that there were a vast number of smaller coins, measuring from the one-eighth to three-eighths of an inch, of which he had none with him, not thinking them of any value; of these he declared there were many thousands.Having shown him some which I procured a few years since from a hoard discovered at Filwood [i.e. the Whitchurch, 1869, Somerset hoard, no. 808] he recognised them instantlythey run very irregular in size and shape, but have the greater portion a crowned head on the obverse - it is in every case in these lesser coins a spiked or rayed crown, which is, I think, a symbol of a British emperor. I have long thought that these are specimens of emergency money of the British usurpers. The other coins from Filton have either the wreathed coronet or the helmeted head upon the obverse. I found both Licinius senior and junior, Crispus, Constantine II., and Constans, as well as the better-known Constantine the Great. The pot in which they were contained was broken, and many had previously been swept away in times of flood. It was of common ware, about three-eighths of an inch thick.Since the visit of the finder to myself, I have had a great number brought to me by other parties; a farmer from the village brought me for inspection a number, which have since been picked up in the brook. He says, scores of villagers were there on Sunday, wading in the muddy stream, and all of them were successful in their groping.

The uniformity of the collection leaves no doubt that it formed part of a single hoard, but what proportion it may represent of the total originally hidden is quite uncertain.The circumstances of discovery make it probable that the hoard was concealed at or near the base of the forward scarp of the inner rampart or perhaps in the near side of the ditch itself, which had already become nearly filled up by late Roman times. No special reason can be suggested for the choice of site for concealment, but the slope below the east rampart has been known, through a number of discoveries during the hundred years since the making of the railway cutting and tunnel, as the site of a Roman cemetery serving the inhabitants of Durnovaria; and some undefined activity in or near the camp itself in the early fourth century AD was attested by the excavations in 1939.'""

The Lyon solidus of Constantine III (RIC X: 1505) is a particularly noteworthy find, slightly amending the closing date (the four G's in the reverse legend indicates striking prior to the death of Arcadius in 408), and considerably increasing the importance of the hoard. No gold of Constantine III occurred in the Hoxne hoard; the Anne Robertson Inventory lists only two British hoards, Stanmore and Eye (RBCH 1619 &amp; 20), both found in 1781 and long dispersed, but which were said to have each contained at least one example. On the continent, the most prolific find of Constantine III gold comes from a hoard of 188 solidi found in 1754 at Menzelen, Germany which apparently included at least 33 examples.

They were found in March, 1824, at Terling Place, near Witham, Essex, with a large hoard of gold and silver coins. The discovery occurred under the following circumstances: some workmen were engaged in forming a new road through Colonel Strutt's Park, and, the earth being soaked by heavy rains, the cartwheels sunk up to their naves. The driver of the cart saw some white spots upon the mud adherent to the wheels, which he imagined to be small buttons: at that moment Colonel Strutt's steward came to the spot, and perceived coins upon the wheels. Not fewer than 300 were picked up at that time. Three days after, Colonel Strutt's steward made further search, and found a small vase, almost perfect, in which had been deposited the two gold rings, and thirty aurei, of the size of a guinea, with several silver coins, all as bright as if recently struck. Several other vases, in which no coins or other objects were found, lay near the spot; they crumbled to pieces on removal; the perfect vase was carried to Terling Place.""The 2 gold rings, 30 solidi, and 304 of the silver coins were also taken to Terling Place, where they were kept, along with two bronze coins, which were apparently found at the same time and place.J. Talbot, in AJ, III (1846), 162f., list of coins, figs. of ringsIn 1933, Lord Rayleigh allowed B.H.St.J. O'Neil to consult manuscript letters describing the find, and to re-examine and re-publish the pot and coins. Mr. O'Neil concluded that the hoard had consisted of a pot of silver coins, which had originally numbered 300-400, and a pot of gold coins numbering 30, along with the two gold rings, while the 2 bronze coins may have come from a Romano-British habitation site in the neighbourhood. The pot which had contained the silver coins had been smashed by the cart wheels.The pot which contained the gold coins was a small jar of hard, fine red ware, 3 1/4 in. high and 2 3/4 in. wide, covered with a lighter red-brown slip. The interior surface was grooved. On the upper part of the pot was a graffito I/VTVXYII.One of the gold rings was about 3/4 in. in diameter, and was made of a thin strip of gold, ornamented with gold wire. The oval bezel was of paste, with an engraved design which is now too worn to identify. The other gold ring was also about 3/4 in. in diameter, and was formed of a flat strip of gold, ornamented with beaded and plaited gold wire. The bezel was lost.M. Henig, Corpus of Roman Engraved Gemstones from British Sites, BAR 8 (1974), ii, 94, no. 724, described the details of the rings as follows: ""Ear of corn. Very schematically represented.

The accession number B 1471 showed that the vessel was part of the late Lord Bathurst's collection, made up of Roman objects found in Cirencester in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. No special find-place was entered in the register, but the coins were there recorded as being in the pot. As both pot and coins were recognizable as late Roman types, it was presumed that the two constituted a hoard, and the coins were therefore sent to Mr. B.H. St.J. O'Neil for examination.The pot is a small squat vessel, with everted rim and a well-marked neck; it measures 4 in. high, 3 1/2 in. rim diameter, increasing to 4 in. on the body; about a third of the rim is missing. It is made of coarse dark grey clay, containing a good deal of pounded shell as 'backing'. The surface is black, except the neck which is grey in irregular patches, due probably to bad stacking in the kiln. The body of the pot has been lightly combed (with ?twigs) when still damp and on the wheel.The letter C has been incised and then pecked out on the shoulder..The Corinium pot is dated by its contents to the very end of the Roman period.

Two pots of coarse grey ware had been buried side by side a short distance below the surface; their rims, broken away by the plough, were missing.Apart from a handful of earlier coins extending back to Gallienus, the great bulk of the hoard was made up of the issues of Constantine the Great and his sons from about AD 320-347. The latest coins were five examples of the FEL TEMP REPARATIO types of Constantius II and Constans, so that the hoard must have been buried within the few years before 350. Although the coins had been removed from their containers by the finder, it was evident from the metal stains that each pot had held different-sized coins. One had contained over 1,650 Constantinian issues minted from about 320-326. All except about 100 were from the mint of London and were in very fine condition with their silver coating often intact. Of the coins of London those of Constantine II Caesar far outnumber those of Constantine I or Crispus. Among the remaining coins nearly all the imperial mints (except Alexandria) were represented by occasional specimens.The second pot contained nearly 4,00 coins, of which the great majority were issued after 335; GLORIA EXERCITVS (one standard) and VICTORIAE DD AVGGQ NN far outnumber any other reverse type, and the great majority were struck at the mint of Trier. The very thin representation of types struck between 326 and 335 (GLORIA EXERCITVS (2 standards), VRBS ROMA, CONSTANTINOPOLIS) is remarkable.The owner, Mr. F.G.

Brown, in an Appendix to ""A Roman Pewter Hoard from Appleford, Berks."" (1968) in Oxon., XXXVIII (1973), 184-206, noted that the Appleford hoard of coins was found in 1954, ""in Appleford Field at a point which must be about 200 yards north of the area of gravel working which produced the pewter"", and described and illustrated the two pots (204-6, figs.):""The first pot (FIG. 10, A), is grey, quite pale in the break and hard, fired at a relatively high temperature. There is a cordon at the base of the neck; the mouth was probably curled over outwards till it was almost horizontal. The base and lower part of the body have been turned, the upper part of the body has been burnished and there is a rough band between them. There is also an unburnished decorative band flanked by grooves just above the belly of the pot.The second pot (FIG. 10, B) seems to be in much the same fabric though it is darker on the surface and darker in the break. Details of the neck are missing. The turned and burnished areas overlap - as they were presumably intended to do - leaving only the single unburnished band around the belly; this is embellished with a burnished wavy line.The general form of these vessels is best paralleled by a number of so-called handleless bottles from the Sandford kiln site (T. May, in Arch., LXXII (1921), 223-42), though the Sandford fabric is softer than these pieces. Hard, smooth-surfaced grey pottery like these two pieces is common in the region though not in dated contexts. Its use for containers for this coin hoard gives a firm date for its manufacture, in the second quarter of the 4th century.""There followed a discussion whether pot A, containing the smaller, earlier part of the hoard was buried before the larger, later part, in pot B. If so, ""this would be an example of banking by burying, the careful saver having taken careful note of the position of his first hoard so that he was able to relocate it and add to it twenty years later.And, from the way in which each hoard comes predominantly from a single mint, it looks as though he received his money en masse rather than by saving, perhaps as a gratuity, perhaps as pay.""""",51.63933888527403,-1.2485335890382974,highest,PAS UK Finds,,2017-08-28 08:25:10.122193

A party of antiquaries, General Younghusband, Captain Bell, Mr. E. Harford, Dr. Bird, and the Rev. T.W. Norwood, visited the locality referred to on the 25th February, 1863, where they found the remains of what had been a large Tumulus, about 20 yards in diameter. There were no indications of those large stones which mark so characteristically so many Cotteswold barrows. A heap of greasy black earth occupied the centre of the area. A human skeleton was found, that of a young person, said to have been of the female sex. It is important to notice that there was but one body here buried, for in our usual chambered Tumuli of unknown age we generally find several bodies. The body is said to have been found lying at length, not doubled up. There were marks of fire on a few bones and stones, and some bits of pottery lying about within the area of the Tumulus were identical in kind with the Roman black pottery of the whole district. In the black earth were found 11 or 12 pieces of flint, of the sort known as 'flint flakes'. These have been found in graves of Roman age, according to Mr. Thomas Wright, as well as in 'primaeval' and Saxon graves, and must often have been brought over long distances.
A piece of rusty iron was found, apparently belonging to the interment. Many Roman coins were found in the Tumulus according to the workmen, not fewer than 200. Six were picked up by Mr. Norwood's party, bearing the names of Valens, Gratianus, Gallienus and Constantine 2nd. The others said to have been found there were mostly small brass of Valens, Valentinian, Tetricus, Gratianus, Victorinus, Gordian, Maximian, Postumus, Tacitus, Claudius Gothicus, Constantine 2nd, Constans and Constantius, with several of the 'Urbs Roma' and 'Constantinopolis' type. With these were five or six small coins, very small and rude, not Roman, but probably struck in imitation of Roman coins. The coins were not contained in any vessel, but were scattered broadcast throughout the mound. Mr. Norwood has come to the conclusion, from the foregoing facts, that this grave was Roman or Romano-British, of the date of about 400 AD; and he gives it as his opinion that in no other instance, in so far as he is aware, has it been found possible to fix an approximate date to an ancient Tumulus with so much probability as in the instance thus brought under our notice.""
Proc. Cotteswold Nat. Field Club III (1865), 198f.
Dr. Bird, a member of Mr. Norwood's party, gave a briefer account in Proc. Cotteswold Nat. Field Club VI, 4 (1876), 335f.:
""The Foxcote Tumulus. In this Tumulus there were two Roman coins and a half found in the black earth, and a broken earthen vessel containing small coins. There was a dry wall across the heap of stones, and a kist near its centre, the ends and sides of it formed of flat stones placed on their edges and covered with flat stones two feet square. The kist contained the remains of only one female.
[Description of skull and bones].
The flint flakes were about fourteen altogether; the largest were in the red earth on the base of the Tumulus. The Tumulus measured twenty-six yards in one direction and twenty-three in the other, and the centre was raised from eight to ten feet.""
G.B. Witts, Arch. Handbook of the Co. of Glos. (1883), 98, said of the Foxcote Tumulus: ""This lies on the top of the hill, one mile south of Dowdeswell, and four miles south-east of Cheltenham"", summarised the accounts given by Rev. T.W.

It was made with pointed stick, thrust into clay deposit overlying foundations of earlier Roman building. There was another similar hole about 3 in. away, but this contained nothing. On the surface of clay lay portion of Roman tile, covering both holes. The hoard deposited after destruction of 2nd C building it overlay. This structure succeeded by a 2nd, larger Roman building on same site, & relationship of hoard to this later building more problematic. It was situated just within NE corner of one of rooms, about 6 in. from inner face of N foundation wall, about 3 ft. from inner corner. The stakehole with coins & tile cover sealed by thin layer of wood-ash, containing late 3rd or early 4th C pot.. This deposited after foundations of 2nd building, piled against their inner face. Above layer of ash was thicker layer of clay mixed with tile frags & wood-ash. All higher levels removed, including floors. Since hoard buried within 2nd building at foundation level, likely it was deposited before floors laid.  Of 32 coins, 2 disintegrated during cleaning, & one corroded & illegible. Another a plain disc of bronze, completely smooth, & poss. a moneyer's blank. hand, are crude. The presence of several die identities, with linked dies, coupled with fresh condition of most coins, suggests they deposited soon after manufacture. The suggestion that coins were foundation deposit is attractive; but petty theft, the concealment of an illegal currency, or even children's play might equally well account for their burial. R.

Mrs. Marsh submitted them, together with the sherds of the pot which once contained them, to the Hampshire County Museum Service for identification.The sherds form part of a New Forest grey ware jar or jug, with decoration in the form of vertical and horizontal grooves, and with saltire crosses scored on its body. This is a known type, catalogued by Fulford (BAR 17 (1975), fig. 33, 20.1). This form had a terminal date of c. AD 350, which is in close agreement with the termination date of the hoard. The sherds recovered constitute only part of the vessel; the rim and base are missing. While the base and body sherds exhibit fresh breaks, the neck is abraded and worn, presumably as a result of plough or cultivation damage.

The coins were declared Treasure Trove at an Inquest held on 23 January 1981.108 coins were found in a nucleus, and 41 scattered in the same area. A further 6 were discovered on a subsequent occasion. Nearly all the coins from the scatter were clipped, showing that clipped coins had been added after the rest of the hoard.The coins came from the same place as the 1978 Otterbourne Treasure Trove of 7 miliarenses and 543 [sic] siliquae. Unfortunately the exact findspot of the first hoard cannot be reliably ascertained, and all that is certain is that the two finds came from the same field. They cannot, however, represent two parts of the same hoard as their compositions are rather different..Then followed lists of the 155 sil. from the 1980 hoard, and of 530 out of the 536 sil. from the 1978 hoard. (The total of coins of Honorius in the 1980 hoard was given as 16 instead of 17, although 17 were actually catalogued, making a total of 155)..""This table shows that the 1978 hoard cut off sharply after 388 (except for six coins of the late 390s from the Milan mint) and consequently had no [sic] clipped coins. The 1980 hoard however is rather later, and is typical of some of the latest Roman silver hoards from Britain with a lot of Milan coins and a large percentage of clipped coins. Although the practice of clipping cannot be certainly dated, it suggests a date in the second decade of the fifth century for the deposition of the 1980 hoard.The presence of the six later coins in the 1978 hoard makes the precise relationship of the two hoards acute: the six were clearly added several years after the bulk of the hoard was deposited, and as they are the sort of coins so plentiful in the 1980 hoard it is tempting to think that they might have been added by the owner of that hoard. But it does not seem possible to be certain whether the two hoards represent two entirely distinct hoards, or are two parts of the same person's property, laid down at different times..A.M.

The hoard has now been dispersed, although the landowner kindly presented 446 pieces (including all the imitations) to the Verulamium Museum, St. Albans, and 244 to the British Museum.The hoard was found with a pot, and I am grateful to Adrian Havercroft of the Verulamium Museum for providing the accompanying drawing and comments. In all nine pieces of pottery were recovered with the hoard. There is no reason to suggest that they belong to more than one vessel, indeed seven of them join to form a base (Fig. 110: 1). The remaining two sherds are considerably thinner in section and are from the upper wall of the vessel.The ware is of medium hardness, with orange-surfaces and has an extremely coarse grey core. Throughout it is tempered with large, hard, light-dark grey grog, with occasional fine black inclusions and (?) flint. The surviving portion of the vessel is well made and indicates a flat base and marked internal rilling of the lower wall. In addition the internal surface is slightly vesiculated. In general terms however the base shows no signs of wear. The edges of several sherds indicate 'old breaks' and there is little doubt that the vessel was cracked 'in situ' prior to its discovery.""A. Havercroft continued his comments by suggesting that the potsherds came from a large jar with a deep, out-turned undercut rim. He compared the form with similar potsherds from the Roman Theatre at Verulamium; Gadebridge; the kiln site at Radlett; and the Roman bath-house at Branch Road, St Albans (cp. Fig. 111: 2).

The hoard sent to Ashmolean Museum where an attempt was made to separate corroded mass into individual elements but without much success & a sig. no. of coins remained fused. A summary report of the hoard's contents was sent to excavators. In 1984 coins were again brought to the Ashmolean Museum for examination. At that time 306 pieces could be isolated & listed. The general condition of the coins was very poor - many were totally illegible or partially so. In initial report it was suggested that coins may have been orig. fused together as result of fire which also caused cup-shape form of some pieces, & that in some cases the side of the coins seems almost to have melted away. This hoard is composed almost entirely of ancient copies to which a few of the very common coins of 330 to 348 were added.

The number of coins in the jar was very great, probably amounting to 5,000. All of these that I have seen were of copper, and most of them exceedingly shabby.

On the other side of the hedge was 'the appearance of an old Stone-pit', which had recently been partially filled in by the freeholder, Amos Ewen, with earth taken from what Mounsey considered to be a tumulus, situated a few yards farther north at the top of the rise. As mentioned above, the bones found at the same time may more probably be connected with this tumulus or adjacent burials than with the coins. Mounsey notes that 'there has been no alteration of the Earth in the memory of man where the Coins were found, and less inequality of the ground on that side of the Fence'.""B.H.St.J.

From the descriptions it is clear that they were all reduced folles of the Constantinian period. Unfortunately the details of the legends are somewhat muddled and none of the coins appears to survive, so it is impossible to check them. However, it is reasonably certain that the coins all fall within the period 322-26 AD and that the mints of London, Trier and Arles are represented. Thus the date of the pot, or at least its last use, is fairly well-established.The money-box itself (Fig. 6) is in a grey-black sandy fabric with a black, burnished surface. The globular body is topped by a small finial, presumably a plug of clay used to seal the neck. A small circular fracture can be seen on the finial near the coin-slot, representing either ancient surface spalling or a junction for a handle; no lower attachment for a handle can be seen however, so its existence is extremely doubtful. The vertical coin slot is formed by what appears to be a saw-cut in the neck some 20 mm long, widened by punching or chiselling. This secondary widening may perhaps represent the finder's attempt to extract the coins. It is impossible to gauge the thickness of the walls except at this point. The base is string-cut and maximum height is 115 mm, maximum diameter 102 mm.""-A.J. White, in Britannia, XII (1981), 302f., fig. of pot-A.J.

The coins are described as 'of the commonest order and value' but no further particulars are given. Hendrew Farm is in the parish of Kemeys Inferior, 5.5 km. (3.5 miles) from Caerleon, near the point where the Roman road running east from Caerleon towards Caerwent crosses a small stream. The farm is near the site of the medieval chapel of Hen Rhiw or St. John the Baptist; the former name derives from the presence of the Roman road. The 6-inch O.S. map shows what appear to be small quarries west of the farm...From the details given, one might assume that the hoard was of late third- or fourth- century date, with the paucity of types or 'reigns' favouring the latter.""There followed a discussion of the composition of the hoard, including a reference to ""the catalogue of coins in Caerleon Museum, drawn up by the Revd.

Evidence from these excavations shows that the Roman land surface was higher than the present surface in the area so that the hoard was probably at a depth of perhaps a foot, close to a prominent land-mark.

Thanks are due to Mr. John Wallis of the company for this facility; pot and coins have now been returned to him.It has become evident, from the quantity of pottery recovered from the gravel pits at Besthorpe, which are between the river Trent and the Fosse Way and four miles north-north-west of Crococalana [...], that a large and important Roman site has now disappeared in the workings..The hoard must have been buried in the late summer of AD 354 - perhaps not very long before the execution of the Caesar Gallus for maladministration in the east (autumn or early winter).""Then came a full discussion of the 978 regular AE coins in the hoard, ranging from Constantine I, Aug. to Constantius Gallus, and of the 369 AE copies, including their place of manufacture, followed by a list of the 978 regular coins arranged according to chronological periods, Pl.

The surface is slightly burnished.The black grit specks superficially resemble those in the common grey ware of 3rd and 4th century date known at the neighbouring sites of Mansfield Woodhouse, Gringley on the Hill, and Hayton, but the fabric of the Besthorpe flask is darker in colour. The neck is probably to be reconstructed as short and cylindrical, ending in a gently out-curved rim. The basic form is very common early in the Roman period and is evidently one of these forms which were revived in the 4th century by Romano-British potters. From about 350 onwards this flask form enjoyed renewed popularity.The firm mid-4th-century date evidenced by the Besthorpe vessel is welcome confirmation on this point.""A. Cotterill, H.B.

A globular jug of slightly earlier date (mid third century) from Stanground Park Farm shows some similarities to our vessel.

From issues before this there are only 8 coins of Constantine and Licinius and their sons, 2 of Tetricus, much worn, and 3 rough copies with radiate heads.

It is uncertain whether the additional fourteen coins were part of the hoard or modern intrusions although in view of Milne's careful listing of the contents by period and by mint the latter seems more likely. Regrettably it is impossible on physical grounds to distinguish the extra coins which may have found their way into the hoard as none can be obviously excluded on the basis of wear, patina, etc. One can, however, thanks to Milne's method of recording the hoard, identify by mint and period the discrepancies between his totals and the new figures. Thus where Milne recorded five radiates, the hoard now has 6; and there are 10 more coins from Lyons than appear in his totals (which included the copies, listed by him as genuine issues). The totals from Arles, Rome, and Heraclea all have one more coin than Milne noted, Cyzicus has one less, and the remaining extra piece belongs in the group of uncertain mintmark.""Cathy E.

A hole some 2m. in diameter was dug at the spot by Mr. Jones and members of his family, and this revealed two Roman earthenware vessels containing the bulk of the hoard. Several more coins scattered by the plough up to 10m. from the vessels were retrieved with the use of a metal detector. The coins, numbering some 4,102 were reported to Mr. K. Mason (then Curator of the Powysland Museum, Welshpool) in April 1982, and were brought to the National Museum of Wales for identification and study. Subsequently a further 614 scattered coins came to light and are included in the catalogue. Therefore, 4,716 coins have been identified, a total probably not far off the number originally buried.The two earthenware containers were found buried just below the surface. The upper parts of both vessels had been disturbed by the plough, and sherds from these scattered.

There are traces of exterior burnishing but most of this has been removed by over-zealous cleaning.

Rober Gwilt, the Lord of the Manor, who kindly placed them in my hands for examination. The precise number found is variously estimated, but it probably did not exceed four hundred.The coins are all of silver, denarii and quinarii of the emperors of the latter part of the last century of the Roman rule in Britain. The majority are in a good state of preservation, and the metal untarnished; in several instances the coins are as brilliant as when first issued from the mint.Of the vessel that contained them, the only portions recovered were the base, with its narrow foot and half the neck, representing a jar of about half a pint in capacity. It had evidently been broken some time previous to its final discovery; and fragments of it had, no doubt, been carried away in former ploughings, without materially disturbing the contents.A visit to the spot, and a careful examination of the soil in the vicinity, resulted in the finding of four other coins, but no further fragments of the crock. The ground around however contained many small shards of different descriptions of pottery, from which I infer that the rising ground hereabouts was the site of dwelling-places during the Roman occupation; and that, beneath the floor of some hut or temporary dwelling, the small hoard was buried in some season of alarm, or for better safety during its owner's absence from home..The coin of Valens, having the letters SPAK in the exergue, is of very rude workmanship, and the letters are upside down, closely following the reverse legend.The proportion of denarii to quinarii is not easy to determine with any exactness, on account of the varying sizes and weights of the coins, and I do not attempt to distinguish them in the list.

Below the plough soil was natural clay into which the pot had been set, but the high water table made it impossible to examine the clay immediately around the pot. The bottom of the pot was approximately 3 feet below the present surface, which roots of turf still showing in the mud proved at this point to have been as yet unaltered by levelling operations. The pot was removed by workmen but they were able to point out the exact spot, and the shape of the pot base could still be felt in the clay under the water..The jar containing the hoard had evidently been broken up by ploughing but enough pieces remained to provide a complete section of the pot (Fig. 1, drawing by L.J. Keen). The fabric is a hard grey; dark grey externally and the core light grey. The rim is simply outcurved and with the neck burnished. Immediately below the neck and between the two deeply sunk handles is an unburnished zone scored with single loops. Below a burnished zone is another unburnished, scored with vertical lines. The rest of the pot, to the flat base, is smoothed..Apart from two third-century Antoniniani of Tetricus I and Tacitus and some 200 small bronzes of the Constantinian dynasty between 317 and 348 the hoard was composed of the type of bronze coinage first introduced by Constantius II and Constans in 348 or by Magnentius and Decentius between 350 and 353. As the hoard contains only two coins of Julian as Caesar, it must have been closed and concealed shortly after the appointment of Julian in 355.""The hoard was said to include only 1,158 regular issues, but in fact a total of 1208 were catalogued. There were also 1287 irregular copies of AE, plus 297 overstruck copies, and ""one further example of 'Censeris' and two more of 'Carausius II'.

The jar was badly broken up, but appeared to be a small jar with a wide neck, of rather coarse, red paste, wheel-turned, of Romano-British type. I was unable to find how the jar had been sealed, but I think the seal must have been a piece of clay.The position of the hoard was about one mile from a fairly extensive Roman villa: latest coin find Theodosian.'The find has the unique peculiarity that every coin it contains has been cut down from its original size of about .7 in. = 17 or 18 mm. to about .5 in. = 13 or 14 mm.""

One point that makes the second hoard almost certain is the lack of wear on these coins of Valentinian I and his co-rulers.

Subsequently, a more thorough surface search by Mr and Mrs Prime later that evening revealed more coins. On 21st May, 141 coins and 5 sherds of pottery with green corroded material adhering to the inner surfaces were brought to Reading Museum for identification. On 26th May, further coins, making a total of 271 in all, and more sherds, including one with a coin-shaped corroded stain on its interior surface, were deposited at the Museum. It was immediately apparent that the coins and some of the sherds were part of a hoard deposited in a pottery vessel which had been broken and some of its contents scattered by the plough a small excavation was undertaken to recover the rest of the scattered coins and sherds, and, if possible, to locate the remainder of the vessel and its contents. To ensure that no coins or other small metal objects were missed, the sieved soil from the excavation was spread on a plastic dustbin-lid and tested for metal using a metal detector. The bottom part of the pot was located the same day still containing a large proportion of the coins A total of 1610 whole coins, 3 coins in two pieces and a small strip of bronze were found The deposition of coins in the pot seems to have been fairly random: coins of different types and emperors are distributed amongst the stratification of the hoard within the beaker as outlined above.

On Saturday night a man who was employed in getting stone out of a quarry at Cleeve Prior, near Evesham, discovered two large earthen pots, which, on examination, he found contained a considerable quantity of coins. He was, of course, greatly overjoyed at the discovery, but having got possession of the idea that the Lord of the Manor would lay claim to the treasure, he refused to tell the quantity of pieces he had found; however, he has disposed of a few which are in the hands of gentlemen in Evesham and neighbourhood. They prove to be gold and silver coins of several Roman Emperors. The gold coins are of the Emperors Valerian [sic], one of the Valentinians, Gratian, and Theodosius. It is scarcely possible to imagine their excellent state of preservation; they appear as if they had just been issued from the mint, not the minutest mark being obliterated, though from 14 to 1500 years have elapsed since they were coined, and, what is very interesting to the antiquarian, counterfeits were discovered among them executed in a most excellent manner, being copper plated with gold. The silver coins are those of Constantius, Julian, Valentinian, Gratian, and Theodosius; these were not in so good a state of preservation as the gold. The execution of these coins is, of course, not very good, the art of cutting the dies being at that period very much upon the decline. The man has acknowledged that he found 100 of the gold ones; the silver ones most probably greatly exceeded that number.""Berrow's Worcester Journal, 31 Oct. 1811; copied in Cheltenham Chronicle, 7 Nov. 1811; abbreviated in Shrewsbury Chronicle, 8 Nov. 1811 copy supplied, 1979, by E.J. Priestley, Clive House Museum, Shrewsbury""I send you an account of the discovery of two earthen pots, the one containing gold, and the other silver Roman coins; found by a labourer while digging in a quarry at Prior's Cleeve, about five miles from Evesham, Worcs., on the 22nd. of October last.The pots are of red earthenware, and I am informed are about 18 inches wide and about the same height; they were full of coins which poured out from the pot when broken by the stroke of the pickaxe.The quantity of gold coin was as much as the fortunate discoverer could carry home at twice. They are of very pure gold, in the most perfect state of preservation, but amongst them are several of copper plated with gold. The silver coins are worn and appear to have been in circulation..The pots stood upon stone of 8 inches in depth, in a stratum of clay of 18 inches: over the pots was placed stone of 4 inches in depth and above that, the natural soil 16 inches in depth from the surface.""Then came a description of gold coins of Valentinian I (3); Gratian (1); Valentinian II (1); and Theodosius (1): silver coins of Constantius II (1); Julian (3); Valentinian I (2); Gratian (1); Valentinian II (1); Theodosius (2).Gent.

Mag., 1814, I, 86, and G. May, Hist. of Evesham (1834), 244 n., gave very brief accounts, the latter, however, adding that the silver coins were ""of the reign of Constantine"" [possibly of Constantius II].BM Mss. Add. 33661, 27 Aug. 1815, also gave a brief account, but did mention 1 AV of Valentinian (I?), and 2 sil. of Gratian and Maximus.Prattinton's Ms. Vol. VII (in Library of Soc. Ant., London) preserved several lists of small collections of coins from the Cleeve Prior hoard.After referring to several of the previous accounts, J. Allies, The ancient British, Roman, Saxon Antiquities and folk-lore of Worcs.., 2 ed. (1852), 91-4, continued:""Rev. R.D. Stillingfleet, Vicar of Cleeve Prior, in answer to some inquiries I made respecting the coins, stated that Thomas Sheppey, the man who found them in the first instance, conveyed them secretly to his own house; that he afterwards took them to the Dean and Chapter of Worcester, (Lords of the Manor), who, after reserving a few of the coins, returned him the remainder..I have seen some of the coins in the possession of Rev. Allen Wheeler, of Worcester, and Rev. Wm. Brown, of Bredicot; in addition to some of the above [i.e. those described in earlier accounts] they have coins of Valerian, D.N.Fl. Victor and Gordianus Pius.Sheppey stated that a goat's head was found in the excavation, which was perhaps a votive offering made upon depositing the coins.After writing the above, I went to Cleeve Prior, and saw at the Rev. Mr. Stillingfleet's, in addition to those previously mentioned, a gold coin of Arcadius, and two silver coins, one of Vespasian, and another which I could not decipher. T. Sheppey, the finder of the urns and coins, informed me that the quantity of gold coins found in one of the urns (which would hold about two quarts) amounted to about six lbs. in weight; that there were about 3000 silver coins in the other urn, which would contain about a gallon; that the goat's head was found four or five yards from the urns, about four feet deep, in a cavity made in the quarry, which cavity was of the shape of a basin at the bottom; that he was offered £700 for the coins, which he refused; that he considered they were worth about £1000 but could not tell the total amount received for them, they having been sold in parcels at various times.the late Rev. Mr. Digby, Canon of Worcester Cathedral, informed me that one of the urns also contained gold coins of Valens, Magnus Maximus, and Arcadius, and he gave me an account of 255 of the gold coins and of 832 of the silver coins.""F. Haverfield, in VCH Worcs., I (1901), 216f. (cp. VCH Worcs. 3 (1913), 308 n.2) observed:""The gold coins included issues of Valentinian I and II, Valens, Gratian, Theodosius and Arcadius. The finder declared that in total they weighed 6 lb, and, if we assume they resembled the ordinary gold coins of the period, they must have numbered between 550 and 600 if the man reckoned by avoirdupois, as a labourer would probably do, or between 450 and 500 if he reckoned by the troy weight usually employed for precious metals. Canon Digby of Offenham gave Mr. Allies an account of 255 of these, but it has not survived. The gold coins are said to have been in singularly good preservation and for the most part to have consisted of very pure gold, but some were only plated copper. This last statement may however be an error, for the gold coinage of the 4th century was almost uniformly pure, and as its value depended largely on its weight, forgeries were necessarily difficult.The silver coins of the hoard included issues of Constantius II, Julian, Valens, Valentinian I, Gratian, Magnus Maximus, Theodosius, and Honorius, with, according to Mr. Allies, one coin of Vespasian. They were stated by the finder to number about 3,000; of 832 Canon Digby gave Mr. Allies an account. The silver coins were, it is said, much more worn than the gold as indeed one might expect. Mr Allies and Mr. May add that the hoard also comprised coins of Gordian, Valerian, Constantine, Valens and Flavius Victor, but they do not mention the metals. Let me further point out that at the Worcestershire Exhibition of 1882 the late Canon A.H. Winnington Ingram, rector of Harvington near Cleeve Prior, exhibited coins from the hoard and an object described in the 'Catalogue' (p. 53) as 'a Roman lady's bronze chatelaine found at Cleeve Prior'. I do not know whether this has anything to do with the hoard nor can I discover what has become either of the coins or the 'chatelaine'.""B.H.St.J. O'Neil, in NC, 1936, 314-16, discussed the previous accounts, and also the information preserved in the Haverfield Mss. (now in the Haverfield Library, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). The presence of coin(s) of Honorius in the hoard is established by a letter from G.L. Eades, 10 May 1901, to Haverfield.The most engaging account of the discovery is in E.A.B. Barnard, Evesham and Four Shires Notes and Queries, II, 1911-14, 219-21.7 sil. from the Cleeve Prior hoard were in the Caerleon Museum (now in NMW, Cardiff) They were said to be of Constantius II (1); Magnentius [sic] (1 VIRTVS ROMANORVM TRPS); Julian II (1); Valentinian II (2), Magnus Maximus (1); Flavius Victor (1).

A boy thrust his hand into the jar and found a great number of what he thought to be gun wads. On the arrival of some of the men the wads were thought to be spade guineas. A general scramble ensued, some filling their caps, others their dinner bags.

Foster, Librarian and Archivist, Yorks. Arch. Soc.At a meeting of the East Riding Antiquarian Society at Driffield, on 4 April 1905, the Rev. E. Maule Cole gave a paper on Roman coins found in the wolds. After dealing with the find at Nunburnholme in 1855, he continued:""Another famous 'find' was that at Cowlam in 1859 [sic], where an immense vase was unearthed by lads at the plough, who filled their pockets with the coins, abandoned their work, and said that they meant to live like gentlemen. In proof of this, Mr. Cole had secured the presence of an old man named Hotham, who was acting as foreman on the Cowlam farm, and was ploughing when the treasure was turned up. Hotham, a veteran of seventy-eight years, hale and hearty, and evidently delighted to be present, stood up, and in reply to Mr. Cole, said there were twelve lads present. 'They all wanted some in their pockets' he added, 'and I took all I could get hold of for my master. It was about half past three in the afternoon, and you should have seen the lads reaching ower the pankin and scramping the money in'. Mr. Cole: 'They meant for the future to live as gentlemen?' Hotham: 'Ay, that they did. They said, ""We'll nivver wark na mair! (Laughter) and they brak off a lump of the pankin in getting it up'. Mr. Cole (proceeding) said the lads had to hand over their spoil, and 10,256 coins were sent to a dealer in London. From him Mr. Christopher Sykes purchased 100 for Mr. Mortimer, and they were in his museum. None were purchased by the British Museum, though some might have found their way since then into the national collection.""F. Haverfield, in Antiquary, XLI (1905), 196; cp. Rev. E.

The coins, comprising three gold solidi and six silver siliquae (one being a contemporary counterfeit), were scattered over an area of several hundred square feet. No trace of any associated container was recovered. The earliest coin recovered is the a siliqua of Constantius II, issued c.AD 353-55. With the exception of a cliche imitation siliqua in the name of Gratian (AD 367-83), all the other coins can be attributed to the reigns of Arcadius (AD 383-408) and his brother and co-emperor Honorius (AD 393-423). Of these the latest coin struck is the Ravenna mint solidus of Honorius, which was issued c.AD 402-06. All of the coins are of types which would have been in circulation at the time of the withdrawal of direct Roman rule from Britain in AD 410. Indeed the four of the officially issued siliquae (# 6-9) are badly clipped, suggesting a date of deposit for those coins of AD 410 or slightly later. The archives of the Yorkshire Museum record the donation to the museum in 1834 of a gold solidus of Honorius (#3) found on the same site .This raises to four the number of late Roman gold coins from the site, and suggests that the coins under consideration may well represent survivors from a hoard which had been initially disturbed by 1834.

The leather immediately mouldered away on exposure to the atmosphere; and the silver urn, which glittered at the first disclosure to the air, assumed an earthy hue; or, as the boy himself expressed it 'all eazed [i.e. decayed] away together'. The Urn is said to have been broad like a bason with an ornamented circular edge turned downwards. The whole treasure weighed two stone. Most of this treasure was soon after transmitted to the lawful owner, the Earl of Aylesbury, on whose estate the discovery was made. Of the silver ornaments, I can, therefore, speak with no certainty. The spoon had a very short inverted handle, and was deep and broad; when perfect, apparently about an inch and a half in length, and near an inch broad. One of the bars of silver was three inches long, three-fourths of an inch broad, and three-eighths thick; the surface very irregular and apparently hammered. Many of the coins towards the top of the Urn (which was, I believe, open) had mouldered into dust, and the ground was actually tinged with a blue colour where they had lain; those in the interior were many of them very perfect; all those I have seen were of the Lower Empire, and of the following emperors: Constantius, Julian, Valentinian, Valens, Gratian, Valentinian the younger, Theodosius, Magnus Maximus, Eugenius, Arcadius, and Honorius. There were no uncommon reverses; but I saw some double denarii, and one of Eugenius.

Williams-Hunt, of the 2nd Bn. Royal Fusiliers, has reported a Roman Site on Chilbolton Down, with signs of occupation from early days to mid-fourth century. It consists of a flat area or terrace on the side of the hill about 60ft. by 18ft. It lies 1 mile 3 furlongs S.W. of the Roman Road running N.W. from Winchester and half a mile S.E. of the straight piece of road running under Woolbury Camp from Stockbridge to Sutton Scotney.The hoard of coins was found about the end of July 1941 by some Royal Artillery gunners in digging a trench, in what appeared to be the site of a rubbish pit with oxen bones, rough pottery shards and general rubbish. The two pottery vessels which contained the coins were shattered and unfortunately half of one disappeared into a sandbag and could not be traced. Fragments will probably be recovered when the sandbags rot. Coins in this vessel were rapidly dispersed amongst the soldiers and not many were recovered. The other vessel was recovered complete except for the handle, which seems to have been lost in ancient times, and one small chip in the shoulder.The contents were about 900 coins, all in very fine condition, bronze or silver washed. Mr. Williams-Hunt had not the exact list when he wrote, but roughly puts the varieties as follows:Constantine I 60 per cent.Crispus 15 per cent.Constantine II 25 per cent.Helena 5 per cent.Licinius 1 coin onlyFausta 5 per cent.Mr. Williams-Hunt disclaims being a coin expert, but with one exception has seen all types before.There is a grand array of different mint marks, but though he has noted these he cannot answer as to their rarity. One exceptional coin is a small bronze one. Obv., a laur. bust; rev., inscription only:-*CONSTANTINUSAUGP.T.R.Incidentally Mr. Williams-Hunt says he has included the common VRBS ROMA and Constantinopolis-types which are well represented under Constantine I in the above estimate.He also sends a 'rather poor snap' he took of the flagons. He has repaired the smaller one, but the larger example is minus the neck, and adds that there are several fragments which do not join.The coins and vessels are, I believe, in the possession of Mr. G.W.

A further pond to S, probably related to recently backfilled pond (Fig 2), was dug out during later construction work by the developers.

The main cluster of coins was spread over at distance of at least 1.0m, suggesting that they had not been within a small container and leaving it unclear whether they represent a single deposit or slightly longer-term event. Other objects from same deposit included the neck of a fine glass unguent bottle & a large lead fitting. The coins & other finds sealed by a soil layer containing stone rubble. The pit fills were sealed by later pond silts, showing that the filling of this pit occurred sometime before the deposition of a layer of building debris across the pond and the adjacent pits.

Upon digging, he found numerous pieces of money; some of which Miss Heyman herself saw; they were all Roman, and small silver coins.

The zone was defined at its upper edge by a tooled line, and vertical lines were made with the same tool down the untreated zone.

Some pottery fragments were also recovered. The pottery fragments and coins were taken to the Dorset County Museum and were subsequently sent to the Ashmolean Museum for classification and cataloguing. The coins were heavily encrusted with a greenish deposit which made them virtually impossible to identify initially. They were subjected to a minimal cleaning treatment which rendered all but two of them legible but left most of the encrustation on the coins.The pottery fragments were examined by Paul Both of the Oxfordshire Archaeological Unit who identified them as black burnished ware produced locally between the first and fourth centuries AD. Many pieces formed part of the same vessel of cooking pot form which, unfortunately, could not be more clearly dated in the absence of its rim. It seems quite likely that the hoard was originally deposited in this pot even though the breaks did not look recent...Composition of the hoard (Table 1)The coins consist of post-reform Tetrarchic folles minted between c. 295 and 310. Forty per cent were minted between 295 and 305, c. 22.4% between 305 and 307 and c. 36% between 307 and 310. The dominant mint is London with 37% of the total, but Trier produced 31% and Lyon c. 18% while the central mints produced c. 12% and the Eastern mints less than 1%. Two coins were illegible...The latest coins in the find occur after the weight reduction of the follis of 1/48th of the Roman pound (giving an average weight if c. 6.77g) which took place at the end of 307 and before the weight reduction to 1/72nd in 310.

""These 186 folles were all struck between AD 296 and 305 and are all in mint condition, any difficulty in deciphering being due to corrosion.

Mossop has drawn attention to a further series which were found there by Mr. Eric Ranby whilst deep-ploughing in 1938/9. The later find consisted of about 400 coins of which 259 survive. They are mainly in fine condition; in a number of cases corrosion has produced small rouleaux of coins, which when separated, show signs of their original plating. No die identities have been noted..The 1939 find was ploughed up in the 'Third West Field near the Caistor Road.'No part of the jar found with the first hoard remains: in the case of the second, the base of a coarse jar was discovered, the fabric typical of much pottery found on the Eastern Wolds of Lincolnshire..The coins of both finds all belong to the first tetrarchy and have the Genio Populi Romani reverse: accordingly the extreme range of date lies between AD 296 and 305.The earlier ploughing would have been no more than 6 in. deep, whereas deep-ploughing penetrates the soil to a depth of 12-14 in., and, in view of the rarity of such finds, the similarity of the reported find-spots and the fact that only the base of the container was found on the second occasion, it is reasonable to suppose that Mr. Ranby's discovery represents the lower half of the Market Stainton hoard published by Miss Robertson..The absence of the Fortuna, Moneta and Providentia reverse types suggests that the hoard closed in or about AD 300 - a view which the mint-marks confirm.""The followed a list of 259 folles.-J.C.

The first group may well be complete, but the second group is almost certainly too small since no coin was included unless it had all the necessary characteristics. One point that makes the second hoard almost certain is the lack of wear on these coins of Valentinian I and his co-rulers.

'EXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY OF COINS. - A very extraordinary discovery was made by a labouring man the other day, while cleaning out a ditch. He found an urn containing 1937 coins, together with 341 ounces of silver, in pieces of various sizes. The coins are Roman, in the most perfect state of preservation, of the most antique description; and what is very singular, no two coins appear to bear the same superscription. The silver is composed of a large number of ingots, and ornamental pieces supposed to have been used on armour for horses. There are also several battle-axes, marked with Roman characters. The whole is now in the possession of Mr. James Gilmour, watchmaker, Coleraine, where they may be seen by anyone curious in the science of numismatics.'
 
Mr Gilmour
soon afterwards placed the entire collection of coins in the hands of my friend, James Carruthers, Esq., the well-known numismatist, who has undertaken to prepare a detailed catalogue of them; the other articles he intrusted to me for a similar purpose. Mr. Gilmour has also explained to me more fully and more correctly than was possible in a hastily written newspaper paragraph, the circumstances connected with their discovery.
The discovery was made in the neighbourhood of Coleraine, viz., in the townland of Ballinrees, parish of Macosquin, and county of Londonderry; about three and a half miles west of Coleraine, and upon the estate of Lady Emily Richardson. It was made, as was stated in the newspapers, by a labouring man, but not 'while cleaning out a ditch'. Had it been so, the inference might have been raised, that the hoard had been deposited in a ditch, and, consequently, since the formation of the existing land-divisions; but from a sketch-map of the field, since furnished to me, it is manifest that the deposit had no reference to any of the present boundaries. Neither was it found in 'an urn'; there was no trace of any vessel or covering; although from the closeness with which the whole lay packed together, it is highly probable that the collection, when deposited in the earth, had been contained in some case, bag, or box, which has utterly decayed, so that no trace of it remains. It was found at such a depth below the surface that it must have been carefully buried in the place where it was discovered; not simply dropped on the surface, and afterwards accidentally interred by the spade or the plough. The soil is 'moory', but seems not to have been covered with water at any time since the deposit of the treasure. The coins in the collection amount to 1506, not 1937, as stated in the paragraph; they are all Roman, and of silver, but small; few being larger than a sixpence, and many considerably less: far from being ""all in the most perfect state of preservation,' many are clipped, defaced, and otherwise injured;- they certainly are not 'of the most antique description', as there is not a single consular coin in the heap; all are of the lower Empire; and there are many duplicates.
 
The silver articles found along with the coins, and placed in my hands, weigh altogether, as ascertained by my friend Mr. Gray, of Castle-place, Belfast, not 341 ounces as stated, but 200 ounces 15 pennyweights, Troy; to which, however, must be added two or three ounces, for the weight of one half of one of the ingots retained by Mr. Gilmour for the purpose of having it assayed. The fracture of this ingot shows the silver to be very fine. The pieces in the 'find' are, briefly, eleven large and four small ingots, or rudely cast short silver bars, unhammered; seven ingots, or lumps of silver, of various shapes and sizes (chiefly small), hammered, and most of them broken; uninscribed: two ingots, or rather fragments of ingots, hammered, and bearing inscriptions; three fragments of what Mr. Carruthers conjectures to have been a large but very thin silver cup, or other similar vessel, rudely ornamented; five fragments of the knobbed rims of broad silver dishes, or perhaps of one such dish, if we suppose the edge to have been divided into compartments ornamented in different patterns, though in the same style; and twenty-five other fragments of manufactured plate, most of them so bruised, broken, and contorted, that it would be difficult to assign to them any definite use. There is no article in the 'find' which could suggest to any but the most inexperienced eye the idea either of 'horse armour', or a 'battle-axe'.""
Then came descriptions of six of the silver pieces, as follows
""1. A fragment of an ornamented silver cover for the lid of a box, or for some such purpose.
2. An elegant strap or narrow plate of silver.
3. A piece of very solid plate.
4. One of the two hammered and inscribed fragments of ingots.
This fragment bears the inscription EXOFPATRICII.
The other inscribed ingot, which is nearly of the same shape, but larger, has only the last part of its inscription, shewing the letters CVRMISSI.
5. A small fragment of a very solid piece of plate, apparently the lid of a flagon.
6. A very elegant silver ornament, which also was one gilt

A discussion of the hoard by H. Mattingly, J.W.E. Pearce and T.D. Kendrick, and illustrations of some of the silver articles appeared in Antiquity, XI (1937), 39-45, pls. I-VI; cp. K.S. Painter in JBAA (3), XXVIII (1965), 1, 6, 7, 12f., 15; and in Ant. J., 52 (1972), 84-92, with photos. of silver ingots
In 1855/6, J. Gilmour sold the silver articles and 88 of the siliquae to the BM. The silver and 30 coins are in Dept. of Prehistoric and Romano-British Antiquities, and 58 of the coins in Dept. of Coins and Medals (BM Register of Antiquities and Coins, Aug. 1855, and Dec. 1856). Among the 58 coins there is one of Constantine III.
More recent studies of the Coleraine silver ingots (8, 2 stamped), other silver articles, and 31 sil., were by J.P.C. Kent and K.S. Painter, Wealth of the Roman World (1977), 125-7, nos. 200-30, photo. of silver bowl. For the silver coins, cp. Cathy E. King, in BNJ, 51 (1981), 6, 8, 11, 14, 16, 18f., giving nos. as 1506 sil., 1 half sil., 341 oz. of silver, c. 50% of coins clipped; also A.M. Burnett, in Britannia, XV (1984), 165f.
J.D. Bateson, in PRIA, 73 (1973), C 2, 42f., listed, with types, 21 sil. from Coleraine in Ulster Museum; cp. ibid., 63f.
M.W.C. Hassall, and R.S.O. Tomlin, in Britannia, XVII (1986), 453, have noted that ""K.S. Painter has recently re-iterated support for the interpretation of Mattingly and Pearce that the second line of the stamp [on one of the silver ingots] should be expanded to cur(ator) missi (onum)"".",54.99660889028446,-7.308575160337328,highest,PAS UK Finds,,2017-08-28 08:25:44.046252
